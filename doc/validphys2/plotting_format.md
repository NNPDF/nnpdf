A *plotting file* defines a set of options that are used for analysis
and representation purposes, particularly to determine how datasets
should be represented in plots and how  should they be grouped
together according to various criteria. The plotting files should be
considered part of the implementation of the dataset, and should be
read by various tools that want to sensibly represent the data.

Naming convention
=================

Given a dataset  labeled `<DATASET>`, a file found in the
`commondata` folder (`nnpdfcpp/data/commondata`) that matches the
regular expression

````
PLOTTING_<DATASET>\.ya?ml
````

(that is, the string `"PLOTTING_"` followed by the name of the
dataset,
and ending in `.yaml` or `.yml`) is to be considering a plotting file
for that dataset.

For example, given the dataset "HERA1CCEP", the corresponding
plotting file name is:

````
PLOTTING_HERA1CCEP.yaml
````

Additionally, the configuration is loaded from a per-process-type file
called:

```
PLOTTINTYPE_<type>.yaml
```

See [Kinamatic labels] below for a list of defined types. When a key
is present both in the dataset-specific and the process type level file, the
dataset-specific one always takes precedence.


Format
======

The plot file specifies the variable as a function of which the data
is to be plotted (in the  *x* axis) as well as the variables as
a function of which the data will be split in different lines in the
same figure or in different figures. The possible variables
('*kinematic labels*') are described below.

The format also allows to control several plotting properties, such
that whether to use log scale, or the axes labels.

## Data label

A key called `dataset_label` can  be used to specify a nice plotting
and display label for each dataset. LaTeX math is allowed between
dollar signs.

## Kinamatic labels

The default kinematic variables are inferred from the *process type*
declared in the commondata files (more specifically from
a substring). Currently they are:

```
'DIS': ('$x$', '$Q^2 (GeV^2)$', '$y$'),
'DYP': ('$y$', '$M^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWJ_JPT': ('$p_T (GeV)$', '$M^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWJ_JRAP': ('$\\eta/y$', '$M^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWJ_MLL': ('$M_{ll} (GeV)$', '$M_{ll}^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWJ_PT': ('$p_T (GeV)$', '$M^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWJ_PTRAP': ('$\\eta/y$', '$p_T^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWJ_RAP': ('$\\eta/y$', '$M^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWK_MLL': ('$M_{ll} (GeV)$', '$M_{ll}^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWK_PT': ('$p_T$ (GeV)', '$M^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWK_PTRAP': ('$\\eta/y$', '$p_T^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'EWK_RAP': ('$\\eta/y$', '$M^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'HIG_RAP': ('$y$', '$M_H^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'HQP_MQQ': ('$M^{QQ} (GeV)$', '$\\mu^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'HQP_PTQ': ('$p_T^Q (GeV)$', '$\\mu^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'HQP_PTQQ': ('$p_T^{QQ} (GeV)$', '$\\mu^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'HQP_YQ': ('$y^Q$', '$\\mu^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'HQP_YQQ': ('$y^{QQ} (GeV)$', '$\\mu^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'INC': ('$0$', '$\\mu^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'JET': ('$\\eta$', '$p_T^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'PHT': ('$\\eta_\\gamma$', '$E_{T,\\gamma}^2 (GeV^2)$', '$\\sqrt{s} (GeV)$'),
'SIA': ('$z$', '$Q^2 (GeV^2)$', '$y$')
```

This mapping is declared as `CommonData.kinLabel_latex` in the C++
code (and accessible as `validphys.plotoptions.core.kinlabels_latex`
in the Python code).

The three kinematic variables are referred to as 'k1', 'k2' and 'k3'
in the plot files. For example, for DIS processes, 'k1' refers to 'x',
'k2' to 'Q', and 'k3 to 'y'. 

These kinematic values can be overridden by some transformation of
them. For that purpose, it is possible to define
a **kinematics_override** key.  The value must be a class defined
in:

`validphys2/src/validphys/plotoptions/kintransforms.py`

The class must have a `__call__` method that takes three parameters:
`(k1, k2 k3)` as defined in the dataset implementation, and return
three new values `(k1', k2', k3')` which are the "transformed"
kinematical variables, which will be used for plotting purposes every
time the kinematic variables k1, k2 and k3 are referred to.
Additionally, the class must implement a `new_labels` method, that
takes the old labels and returns the new ones, and an `xq2map`
function that takes the kinematic variables and returns a tuple of (x,
QÂ²) with some approximate values. An example of such transform is:

````python
class dis_sqrt_scale:
    def __call__(self, k1, k2, k3):
        ecm = sqrt(k2/(k1*k3))
        return k1, sqrt(k2), ceil(ecm)

    def new_labels(self, *old_labels):
        return ('$x$', '$Q$ (GeV)', r'$\sqrt{s} (GeV)$')

    def xq2map(self, k1, k2, k3, **extra_labels):
        return k1, k2*k2
````


Additional labels can be specified by declaring an **extra_labels**
key in the plotting file, and specifying for each new label a value
for each point in the dataset.

For example:

````
extra_labels:
    idat2bin:  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 200, 200, 200, 300, 300, 300, 400, 400, 400, 500, 500, 600, 600, 700, 700, 800, 800, 900, 1000, 1000, 1100]
````

defines one label where the values for each of the datapoints are
given in the list. Note that the name of the extra_label (in this case
`idat2bin` is completely arbitrary, and will be used for plotting
purposes (LaTeX math syntax is allowed as well). However adding labels
manually for each point can be tedious. This should only be reserved
for information that cannot be recovered from the kinematics as
defined in the CommonData file. Instead, new labels can be generated
programmatically: Every function defined in:


`validphys2/src/validphys/plotoptions/labelers.py`

is a valid label. These functions take as keyword arguments the
(possibly transformed) kinematical variables, as well as any extra
label declared in the plotting file. For example, one might declare:

````
def high_xq(k1, k2, k3, **kwargs):
    return k1 > 1e-2 and k2 > 1000

````

Note that it is convenient to always declare the '\*\*kwargs'
parameter so that the code doesn't crash when the function is called
with extra arguments. Similarly to the kinematics transforms, it is
possible to decorate them with a `@label` describing a nicer latex
label than the function name. For example:

````
@label(r"$I(x>10^{-2})\times I(Q > 1000 GeV)$")
def high_xq(k1, k2, k3, **kwargs):
    return (k1 > 1e-2) & (k2 > 1000)

````

## Plotting and grouping

The variable as function of which the data is plotted, is simply
declared as 

````
x: <label>
````

For example:

````
x: k1
````

If a `line_by` key is specified, variables with different values for
each of the labels listed, will be represented as different lines. For
example,

````
line_by:
  - k2
````

for DIS would mean that the data in the same Q bin is plotted in the
same line.

Similarly, it is possible to define a `figure_by` key: Points
with different values for the listed keys will be split across
separated figures. For example:

````
figure_by:
  - idat2bin
  - high_xq
````

## Transforming the result

By default the y axis represents the central value and error. However
it is possible to define a results_transform in the plotting file:

````
result_transform: qbinexp
````

The value must be a function declared in

`validphys2/src/validphys/plotoptions/results_transform.py`

taking the error, the central value as well as all the labels, and
returning a new error and central value. For example:

````
def qbinexp(cv, error, **labels):
    q = labels['k2']
    qbin = bins(q)
    return 10**qbin*cv, 10**qbin*error
````

## Plotting options

Several plotting options can be specified.
These include

 - x/y_scale: 'linear' or 'log'.
 - x/y_label: Any string, possibly latex formatted. Note that the
	 x_label will be deduced automatically.

## Overriding configuration for normalized plots

When the results are to be plotted as a ratio, it may be convenient to
alter the configuration of the plots, for example by changing the
`line_by` labels into `figure_by` (because otherwise the points would
overlap), or by changing the scale from log to linear. To do so, we
specify the options we want to override in a `normalize` key.
Everything defined inside will take precedence when we produce a ratio
plot and will be ignored for absolute value plots. For example:
```yaml
x: k1

x_label: '$\left\|\eta/y\right|$'

y_label: '$d\sigma/dy$ (fb)'

line_by:
  - Boson

normalize:
    figure_by:
        - Boson

extra_labels:
   Boson:  ["$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^+$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$W^-$","$Z$","$Z$","$Z$","$Z$","$Z$","$Z$","$Z$","$Z$"]

```
Here, we would split the data by different figure files for each
unique value of the key `Boson` (which is defined explicitly as an
`extra_label`), but only one plots with the three bosons split across
different lines will be produced in absolute value plots.

## Metadata keys

Plotting files are also used to define metada related to the various
datasets. These keys include:

  - `experiment` (string): The experiment which produced the experimental data.
  - `process_description` (string): A description of the physical process
  associated to the dataset. This would typically be defined in the
  `PLOTTINTYPE` files.
  - `data_reference` (string): a LaTex key corresponding to the
  reference of the experimental paper.
  - `theory_reference` (string): a LaTeX key corresponding to the
  codes used to compute the theory predictions.

# Example

A complete example (all keys are optional) looks like this:

```yaml

dataset_label: "Some hypothetical dataset"
experiment: ATLAS
x: k3
x_scale: log
kinematics_override: dummy_transform #defined in transforms.py
line_by:
  - k2

figure_by:
  - idat2bin #defined below
  - high_xq  #defined in labelers.py

normalize: # Change the scale for ratio plots
    x_scale: linear

extra_labels:
    idat2bin:  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 200, 200, 200, 300, 300, 300, 400, 400, 400, 500, 500, 600, 600, 700, 700, 800, 800, 900, 1000, 1000, 1100]
