% Validphys 2 guide
% Zahari Kassabov, SC

Introduction
============

The immediate aim of `validphys2` is to serve as a both very agile and
highly reliable analysis framework for NNPDF, but the goal extends
beyond. When the time comes, this framework should become the common
gateway that all the NNPDF code uses, providing features ranging from
from automated report generation to automatic detection of problems
with the fits.

The project is separated in two codes with well defined and separated
scopes:

reportengine 
  ~ It is a compiler of user-entered configuration (in the YAML
  format) into directed acyclic graphs of Python executable functions,
  which are defined by client applications. One such function that
  comes with `reportengine` is `report`, which processes a template in
  the Markdown format, with special tags that signify the resources
  requested by the user, and produces  an HTML report (See [Reports]).
  Apart from the *compiler* functionality, `reportengine` also
  provides general application utilities such as crash handlers and
  a help system.

validphys2
 ~ It is a set of higher level tools operating on the NNPDF resources,
 which can be used either within a `reportengine` application or
 standalone. It is based on the `libnnpdf` Python wrappers, and
 extends them with extra functionality (related to error checking,
 loading and downloading among others). The NNPDF objects are then
 used in functions producing plots, tables and other outputs (such as
 reweighted PDF sets).

What is working
---------------

Right now the following features are implemented:

 - Processing of libnnpdf resources.
 - Data-Theory plotting specification.
 - PDF comparisons.
 - A framework for fitting parameters such as $\alpha_S$ bases on
   series of fits.
 - Plots and tables showing statistical estimators.
 - Generation of reweighted sets.
 - Report generation from templates.
 - Automatic downloading of PDFs, fits and theories.
 - Automatic uploading of reports and other outputs.
 - Standalone executables implementing functionality such as `postfit` or
   uploading and downloading resources.


These features are documented in more detail in [Usage].

Design considerations
=====================

Look before you leap
--------------------

A scientific program usually requires a large set of complex input
parameters and can take a very long time to produce results. Results
tend to be frequently unexpected even if everything is working
correctly. It is essential to check that the inputs are correct and
make sense. Thus good error reporting capabilities are an important
design consideration.

Also, the inputs of a given function should be checked as
early as possible, which is not necessarily at the point of the
program where the function is to be called. For example, something
like this:

```python
def check_parameter_is_correct(parameter):
    ...

def plot(complex_calculation, parameter):
    check_parameter_is_correct(parameter)
    #make plot
    ...
```

has the disadvantage that in order to get to the check, we presumably
need to compute `complex_calculation` first, and that could be
a waste of time if it turns out that `parameter` is not correct for
some reason and we can’t do the plot anyway. Instead we should arrange
to call `check_parameter_is_correct(parameter)` as early as
possible (outside the plotting function) and show the user an
informative error message.

>   All inputs should be checked as early as possible. If the checks
>	pass, the program should not fail.

Of course it is impossible to guarantee that this is always going to
happen. For example it is possible that we check that a folder exists
and we have permissions to write to it, but by the time we actually
need to write, the folder has been deleted. However in such cases the
state of the program can be considered broken and it’s OK to make it
fail completely.

There is an API for early checks in `reportengine`. We would write
something like:

```python
@make_argcheck
def check_parameter_is_correct(parameter):
    ...

@check_parameter_is_correct
def plot(complex_calculation, parameter):
    #make plot
    ...
```

The checking function will now be called as soon as the program
realizes that the plot function will be required eventually (at
“compile time”). The user would be shown immediately an error message
explaining why the parameter is wrong.

The fancy term for this style of coding is *Contract Programming*.

Declarative input
-----------------

It is extremely convenient to be able to specify the *what* the program
should only without any regard of knowledge of *how* that is achieved
by the underlying
implementation. The current nnfit input files are a good example of
this. The primary input of validphys are YAML run cards. A very simple
one looks like this:
```yaml
pdfs:
    - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
    - NNPDF30_nnlo_as_0118
    - CT14nlo

norm:
    normalize_to: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118

first:
    Q: 1
    flavours: [up, down, gluon]

second:
    Q: 100
    xgrid: linear

actions_:
    - first::norm plot_pdfreplicas
	- first plot_pdfs
	- second plot_pdfreplicas
```

Correct by definition

:   A declarative input specifies what you want. It is up to the
underlying code to try to provide it (or fail with an informative
message).

Obvious meaning

:   It is easy for a human to verify that the input is indeed what it
was intended. Even without any explanation it should be easy enough to
guess what the runcard above does.

Implementation independent

:   The input is very loosely coupled with the underlying
implementation, and therefore it is likely to remain valid even after
big changes in the code are made. For example, in the runcard above,
we didn't have to concern ourselves with how LHAPDF grids are loaded,
and how the values of the PDFs are reused to produce the different
plots.  Therefore the underlying mechanism could change easily without
breaking the runcard.

Therefore:

-   The primary input mechanism should be an easy to read input with
	an obvious meaning and independent of implementation details.

Usage as a programmatic API
---------------------------

While the goal of reportengine is to allow simple and easily
repeatable bach actions, sometimes it is far simpler to get the work
done with a raw (Python) script, or it is needed to explore the
outcomes using something like an Jupyter notebook. It would be good to
be able to use all the tools that already exist in validphys for that,
without needing to reinvent the wheel or to alter functions so that
for example they don’t write data to some preconfigured path.
Therefore:

-   The various computing and plotting tools should work well when
	included in a normal script that doesn't use the reportengine
	graph compiler.

This is implemented by making sure that as much as possible all the
validphys functions are *pure.* That is, the output is a deterministic
function of the inputs, and the function has no side effects (e.g. no
global state of the program is altered, nothing is written to disk).
There are some exceptions to this though. For example the function
that produces a reweighted PDF set needs to write the result to disk.
The paths and side effects for other more common results like figures
are managed by `reportengine`. For example, the `@figure` decorator
applied to a function that returns a Python (`matplotlib`) figure will
make sure that the figure is saved in the output path, with a nice
filename, while having no effect at all outside the `reportengine`
loop.  The same goes for the check functions described above.

Easy to loop
------------

Very frequently there is the need to compare. It is easy enough to
write simple scripts that loop over the required configurations, but
that cannot scale well when requirements change rapidly (and is also
easy to make trivial mistakes). Therefore reportengine allows
configurations to easily loop over different sets of inputs. For
example the following runcard:

```yaml
pdfs:
    - id:  160502-r82cacd2-jr-001
      label: Baseline

    - id: 160502-r82cacd2-jr-008
      label: HERA+LHCb

    - id: 160603-r654e559-jr-003
      label: baseline+LHCb and Tev legacy

fit: 160603-r654e559-jr-003
theoryids:
    - 52
    - 53
use_cuts : nocuts

experiments:
  - experiment: LHCb
    datasets:
      - { dataset: LHCBWZMU7TEV, cfac: [NRM] }
      - { dataset: LHCBWZMU8TEV, cfac: [NRM] }

  - experiment: ATLAS
    datasets:
      - { dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB}

actions_:
 - theoryids::pdfs::experiments::experiment plot_fancy
```

Will produce a separate plot for each combination of the two theories
(52 and 53), the three pdfs at the top, and each dataset in the two
experiments (so 18 plots in total). This syntax is discussed in more
detail in the [Usage] section.

 -   It should be trivial to repeat an action for different sets of
	 inputs.

Lazy processing
---------------

The requirements above (in particular the combination of early
checking and arbitrary looping) lead to the condition that the value
of the resources depends on the other resources involved. For example,
a dataset requires a theoryid in order to locate the FKTables and
cfactors, and we want to check that these paths exist early on.

Therefore the processing always
starts from the user requirement (i.e. the requested actions) and
processes each requirement for that action within the correct context,
trying to avoid duplicating work.
Conversely we ignore everything that is not required to process the
actions.

Usage
=====

Installing
----------

A lot of work has gone into producing a usable installer that works on
both Linux and Mac. Currently the installation for both platforms
boils down to executing a script.

Producing installers is a difficult (and boring) problem since a lot
of dependencies need to be set up to work properly together. In
practice, it is hard to produce a set of instructions that work
reliably on all platforms and with all compilers. This is further
complicated by the fact that the Python deployment tools are
substandard in several ways (such as avoiding unwanted interaction
between libraries for Python 2 and Python 3). Furthermore, on Mac gcc
and clang interact poorly when it comes to including the C++ standard
library, and a lot of care has to be taken to include the correct one.

The solution to all that is to provide precompiled versions of all the
dependencies, that are generated automatically when new commits are
pushed to the CERN Gitlab server (for Linux) and the Travis CI server
(for Mac).

The compiled binaries are subsequently packaged (using conda) and
uploaded to a remote server where they are accessible. These packages
are known to compile on clean default environments (namely those of
the CI servers used to produce the packages), and the Python packages
are known to be importable. Everything that an user has to do is to
configure `conda` correctly and ask it to install the `nnpdf`. This
results in an environment that contains not only an usable version of
validphys, but also of the nnpdf code and all its dependencies
(including for example LHAPDF and APFEL). Therefore an user who
doesn't need to modify the code should not need to compile anything to
work with the NNPDF related programs.  This should be useful in
clusters where we don’t completely control the environment and
frequently need to deal with outdated compilers.

### Installation steps

A helper script exists to aid the configuration. All you need to do
is:

    #Obtain the helper script
    git clone git@github.com:NNPDF/binary-bootstrap.git
    #Execute the script
    ./binary-bootstrap/bootstrap.sh

The script will ask for the password of the NNPDF private
repositories. You can find it here:

<https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=nnpdfwiki&title=Git+repository+instructions>

The conda installer will ask to add the conda bin path to the default
`$PATH` environment variable (by editing your `.bashrc` file). Confirm
this unless you know that you have a specific reason not to. Note that
newer versions of conda give the option of having `conda` available,
but not any environment (which you have to enable explicitly by either
having `conda activate` in `.bashrc` or typing it each time you want
to use the environment). On remote machines, the addition to `.bashrc`
should read as follows:

```bash
if shopt -q login_shell; then
    . /home/zaharik/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate
fi
```
the if condition is important because `conda activate` prints to the
standard output, which interferes with commands like `scp` and
`rsync`.

Not that the script may ask you to perform some actions manually (e.g.
it will not overwrite your existing conda configuration). Please
pay attention to the output text of the script.

Once everything is configured, you can install the code running:

    conda install nnpdf

This will provide functioning C++ and Python executables.

#### Linking existing LHAPDF grids

The installer will set up it's own version of the LHAPDF code, with
its own path for storing PDFs, which can be seen running `lhapdf
--help`. If you have an exiting folder with LHAPDF grids, you may want
to either move, symlink or copy them to the new path (depending on
whether you want to keep around the older installation). The command
for symlinking would be something like:

```
ln -s <old path>/share/LHAPDF/* <new path>/miniconda3/share/LHAPDF
```

This will avoid symlinking the existing LHAPDF configuration, which
may be corrupted or incompatible. You should make sure only the grid
folders are transferred if you copy or move instead.


### Troubleshooting

After several iterations on the install system most issues have been
resolved. There could be problems derived from interactions with hacks
targeted at solving environment problems manually. In particular, see
that you don’t have any `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (for example
pointing at some version of LHAPDF) since that will overwrite the
default conda configuration. This is easily solved by removing said
hacks from `.bashrc` or similar files.

A different source of problems is the priority order of the conda
*channels*: We use dependency packages from the official Anaconda
`defaults` channel, as well as from the community `conda-forge`
channel. If a package exists in both channels, the one from the
channel declared first `.condarc` file is the one that gets selected.
Unfortunately the packages are not always binary compatible and
therefore the wrong priority causes various sorts of compiler errors.
Also unfortunately, what the wrong priority is changes over time,
depending on the features that both channels provide. Currently we use
the compilers from the `defaults` channel, and therefore it has to be
declared first.

If you include conda in your default PATH, the default Python version
will be the conda Python 3. This could cause problems if you use code
that expects `/usr/bin/env python` to point to Python 2. In such cases
you will need to conditionally enable or disable conda. You can save
a helper executable script (called for example `use-conda`) to some
location in your PATH containing:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
unset PYTHONPATH
export PATH= /your/conda/folder/bin:$PATH
```

Remember to `chmod +x use-conda`. Now typing:
```
source use-conda
```
will set your PATH environment variable to point to the conda
binaries.

In any case this tends to not be a problem for newer software as
Python 3 gains support.

### Development installs

Installing the `nnpdf` conda package is sufficient for running the
NNPDF tools.  In addition it is possible to set up a development
environment in a way that it can be modified and then rebuilt. In
general, you can install all the runtime dependencies of a package
(like) `nnpdf` with  `conda install <package> --only-deps`. Note that
you still need to obtain the build dependencies.

The development environment as described here works for developing the
NNPDF code. Other external projects might work within the development
environment in a similar way, but configuring them may prove more
difficult (for example due to build scripts with hard coded paths).
Thus contributing conda recipes for those is highly encouraged when
they can be generally useful.



#### Setting up a C++ development environment

The easiest way to work with C++ code that depends on `nnpdf` or
other C++ packages (or indeed to develop `nnpdf` itself) is to set
up a development `conda` environment. While the existing packages
should run on any relevant Linux or Mac system, linking to them is
a different matter: The most straightforward  way of doing so is using
the same compiler toolchain that was used to generate the packages.
You may find some relevant documentation [here][COMPILERS].  You need
to create a conda environment that has the required dependencies of
your project, including the relevant build toolchain (including things
like a C++ compiler). For example here is how we would set up a
development environment for `nnpdf`.

 1. Find out the C++ (or C or FORTRAN) compiler package name for your
	platform [here][COMPILERS]. For example, the C++ compilers for
	Linux and macOS are `gxx_linux-64` and `clangxx_osx-64` respectively.

 2. Create an environment with all the build and runtime
	dependencies. We start off with:
	```bash
	$ conda create -n nnpdf-dev
	#Install the runtime dependencies of nnpdf
	$ conda install --only-deps nnpdf
	#Install the c++ compiler for Linux (see above)
	$ conda install gxx_linux-64
	```
	Note that when the environment is activated, many environment
	variables pointing to the compiler paths are activated for us:
	```
	$ source activate nnpdf-dev
	INFO: activate-binutils_linux-64.sh made the following
	environmental changes:

	```
	These environment variables are read and interpreted by build
	systems such as `cmake`, so that building a project normally will
	use the conda compilers, when the build system has been configured
	with this environment. Note that for `cmake` this means that the
	environment has to be activated at the moment you run the `cmake`
	executable.

3.	Obtain the dependencies of the code you want to build. Where to
	find those depends on the particular cod.  For example, something
	linking to `libnnpdf` will likely require `pkg-config`.  Projects
	based on `autotools` (those that have a `./configure` script) will
	additionally require `automake` and `libtool`. Similarly projects
	based on `cmake` will require installing the `cmake` package. In
	the case of `nnpdf` itself, the build dependencies can be found in
	`<nnodf git root>/conda-recipe/meta.yaml`. We have to install the
	remaining ones manually:

	```
	$ conda install pkg-config swig=3.0.10 cmake
	```
	Where we also installed the C++ compiler in the previous step.

	Note that you should not have the `nnpdf` package installed in the
	conda environment used for development. You can remove it with
	`conda remove nnpdf`.


 4. Build the project: Assuming the environment is set, the only
	remaining requirement is setting the installation prefix to point
	to the `conda` environment. This is conveniently stored in the
	`$CONDA_PREFIX` environment variable. We would build the nnpdf
	project like this:
	```bash
	nnpdf$ mkdir conda-bld
	nnpdf$ cd conda-bld
	#We have something like $CONDA_PREFIX==~/anaconda3/envs/nnpdf-dev/
	nnpdf/conda-bld$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX
	```
	Note that you need to execute this while the environment created
	above is activated.  Both the compilers and all dependencies are now found
	inside the environment. The output of the `cmake` command above
	is:
	```
    -- Setting build type to 'Release' as none was specified.
    -- The C compiler identification is GNU 7.2.0
    -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 7.2.0
    -- Check for working C compiler: /home/zah/anaconda3/envs/nnpdf-dev/bin/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-cc
    -- Check for working C compiler: /home/zah/anaconda3/envs/nnpdf-dev/bin/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-cc -- works

    -- Checking for one of the modules 'yaml-cpp'
    -- Configuring done
    -- Generating done
    -- Build files have been written to: /home/zah/nngit/libnnpdf/conda-bld
	```
	We can now proceed normally:
	```
	$ make
	$ make install
	```
	This should result in a working installation, both for the C++ and
	Python parts of the code.

 5. Use the result. For example, we can now compile `buildmaster`
	linking with the `libnnpdf` library we just created. Since the
	conda environment is all set and `buildmaster` installs in a fixed location
  by default, no additional configuration is necessary:
	```
	buildmaster$ mkdir bld && cd bld
	buildmaster/bld$ cmake ..
	buildmaster/bld$ make -j && make install
	```

#### Developing Python projects

Python code should be installed in the specific folder of the conda
environment. This is handled automatically when the environment is
activated. Like with C++ projects we need to make sure to have the
correct dependencies in our environment, and that varies by project.

In addition since we do not need to compile Python we would
like that the changes we make to the code are reflected automatically
when we run it. To that end, we can run the following command for
projects containing a `setup.py` file.

```
pip install --ignore-installed  -e .
```

This command will symlink the relevant files to our conda prefix and
allow the modules to me imported from the conda version of python.
Note that the validphys2 works like this by default when you install
the `nnpdf` project with `make install`, and so does not require any
additional configuration.


### Updating

In most cases running `conda update <package>` will do the right
thing, and update the package with the requested dependencies.

If you are interested in a specific version (not necessarily the
latest one), you can run `conda install <package>=<version>`.

Note that, in case you are doing [Development installs], the process
is somewhat more manual, and you might need to update each dependency
of the package you are developing. A convenient shortcut might be to
install the desired version of the development package with conda, so
it takes care of the dependencies, and the conda version and setting
up the development version again.

Seeing what actions are available
---------------------------------

A help command is generated automatically by reportengine. The command
```bash
validphys --help
```
will show you the modules that contain the actions (as well as the
usual description of the command line flags). For example,

```bash
validphys --help validphys.plots
```

will list all the actions defined in the plots module together with
a brief description of each of them. Asking for the
help of one of the actions, like for example:
```bash
validphys --help plot_fancy
```
will list all the inputs that are required for this action. For
example the command below results currently in the following output:

```
plot_fancy

Defined in: validphys.dataplots

Generates: figuregen

plot_fancy(one_or_more_results, commondata, cuts, normalize_to:
  (<class 'int'>, <class 'str'>, <class 'NoneType'>) = None)

Read the PLOTTING configuration for the dataset and generate the
corrspondig data theory plot.

The input results are assumed to be such that the first one is the
data, and the subsequent ones are the predictions for the PDFfs. See
``one_or_more_results``. The labelling of the predictions can be
influenced by setting ``label`` attribute of theories and pdfs.

normalize_to: should be either 'data', a pdf id or an index of the
result (0 for the data, and i for the ith pdf). None means plotting
absolute values.

See docs/plotting_format.md for details on the format of the PLOTTING
files.

The following resources are read from the configuration:

    dataset_input: The mapping that corresponds to the dataset
  specifications in the fit files
  [Used by commondata]

    theoryid: A number corresponding to the database theory ID where
  the corresponding theory folder is installed in te data directory.
  Either just an id (str or int), or a mapping with 'id' and 'label'.
  [Used by cuts]

    use_cuts(bool or str): Whether to filter the points based on the
  cuts applied in the fit, or the whole data in the dataset. The
  possible options are:
  
  - internal: Calculate the cuts based on the existing rules. This
  is
    the default.
  
  - fromfit: Read the cuts stored in the fit.
  
  - nocuts: Use the whole dataset.
  [Used by cuts]

    fit: A fit in the results folder, containing at least a valid
  filter result. Either just an id (str), or a mapping with 'id' and
  'label'.
  [Used by commondata]

    use_fitcommondata(bool): Use the commondata files in the fit
  instead of those in the data directory.
  [Used by commondata]

    pdfs(list): A list of pdf objects.
  [Used by one_or_more_results]

    pdf: A PDF set installed in LHAPDF. Either just an id (str), or a
  mapping with 'id' and 'label'.
  [Used by one_or_more_results]

    use_t0(bool): Whether to use the t0 PDF set to generate
  covariance matrices.
  [Used by t0set]

    t0pdfset: PDF set used to generate the t0 covmat.
  [Used by t0set]

The following additionl arguments can be used to control the
behaviour. They are set by default to sensible values:

  normalize_to(int or str or NoneType) = None
  q2min(Number or NoneType) = None [Used by cuts]
  w2min(Number or NoneType) = None [Used by cuts]
  check_plotting(bool) = False [Used by dataset]
```

We can see which keys have a special meaning in the configuration file
with:

```bash
validphys --help config
```

All other keys are interpreted literally (although they could be
further processed by specific actions).



Writing input cards
--------------------

Input cards are YAML files that describe the input resources, together
with the actions we want to perform on them.

Let's begin with a simple example:
```yaml
pdf: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118

theoryid: 52

use_cuts: "nocuts"

dataset_input:
    dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB
    cfac: [EWK]

actions_:
  - plot_fancy
  - plot_chi2dist

```

We are specifying one PDF (by the LHAPDF id), one dataset and one
theory. Note that the dataset specification is identical to that of
the nnfit configuration files.

We are saying that we do not want to use the cuts of the data
(so we don't have to specify a fit containing the cut data).

The special `actions_` key is used to declare the actions we want to
have executed. The syntax is the same as for the targets inside the
report, and discussed in detail in the [Report template
specification].  We want a data/theory comparison (plot_fancy) and to
plot the distribution of the chi² for each replica (plot_chi2dist). If
we save the above runcard to a file called `runcard.yaml` we can
produce the plots with:
```bash
validphys runcard.yaml
```

### Multiple inputs and namespaces

Resources can be declared at top level, like in the example above,
inside a mapping (with an arbitrary key), or inside an element of
a list of mappings.

#### Arbitrary namespaces

For example, we can modify the example as follows:

```yaml
pdf: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118

theoryid: 52

fit: 161222-jr-004

with_cuts:
  use_cuts: "fromfit"

without_cuts:
  use_cuts: "nocuts"

dataset_input:
    dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB
    cfac: [EWK]

actions_:
  - with_cuts plot_fancy
  - without_cuts plot_chi2dist

```

Here `with_cuts` and `without_cuts` are *arbitrary* strings that
specify *namespaces*. Now we are asking for one action (`plot_fancy`)
to be executed taking into account the cuts (note that we have also
specified the fit where we read them from) and another
(`plot_chi2dist`) to be executed without the cuts.  Similar to
a programming language like C, the inner namespaces has priority with
respect to the outer. For example if we add a PDF specification to the
"with_cuts" namespace like this:


```yaml
pdf: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118

theoryid: 52

fit: 161222-jr-004

with_cuts:
  use_cuts: "fromfit"
  pdf: CT14nlo

without_cuts:
  use_cuts: "nocuts"

dataset_input:
    dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB
    cfac: [EWK]

actions_:
  - with_cuts plot_fancy

  - without_cuts plot_chi2dist

```

The `plot_fancy` action will ignore the outer pdf
(NNPDF30\_nlo\_as\_0118) and use the one defined in the innermost
namespace (CT14nlo). Because we have not specified `plot_chi2dist` to
be executed within the `with_cuts` namespace, it will continue to use
NNPDF.


#### Lists of namespaces

We can also have lists of mapping acting as namespaces. The action
will then be repeated inside each of the namespaces generating one
result for each. For example:

```yaml
pdf: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118

theoryid: 52

fit: 161222-jr-004

specifications:
- use_cuts: "fromfit"
  pdf: CT14nlo

- use_cuts: "nocuts"

dataset_input:
    dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB
    cfac: [EWK]

actions_:
  - specifications plot_fancy

```

Now a different `plot_fancy` action will be executed for each of the
two mappings of the list "*specifications*": One will use the CT PDF
and use the cuts, and the other will plot all points in the dataset.

Some keys are appropriately interpreted either as lists of objects or
list or namespaces depending on the context. They are documented in
`validphys --help config`. For example, the `pdfs` key is entered as
a list of LHAPDF ids:

```yaml
pdfs:
  - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
  - CT14nlo
```

Because the `plot_fancy` action takes a list of pdfs as input,
something like this:

```yaml
pdfs:
  - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
  - CT14nlo

theoryid: 52

use_cuts: "nocuts"

dataset_input:
    dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB
    cfac: [EWK]

actions_:
  - plot_fancy

```

will produce plots where the two pdfs appear together. However
we can also produce individual plots for each pdf, by simply
specifying that we want to loop over the pdfs:

```yaml
pdfs:
  - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
  - CT14nlo

theoryid: 52

use_cuts: "nocuts"

dataset_input:
    dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB
    cfac: [EWK]

actions_:
  - pdfs plot_fancy

```

In this case the value of the `pdfs` key is seen as equivalent to:

```yaml
pdfs:
  - {pdf: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118}
  - {pdf: CT14nlo}
```

However the special treatment allows us to simplify both the input
file and the programmatic interface of the functions (see
[Automatic Lists]).

### Nesting namespaces

Namespace specifications like those described above can be arbitrarily
nested. Values will be searched from inner to outer namespace. When
the namespace specifications represent lists of mappings, all possible
combinations will be produced.

Consider the example:
```yaml
pdfs:
    - 160502-r82cacd2-jr-001

    - 160502-r82cacd2-jr-008

    - 160603-r654e559-jr-003

fit: 160603-r654e559-jr-003
theoryids:
    - 52
    - 53

with_cuts:
    use_cuts : "nocuts"

experiments:
  - experiment: LHCb
    datasets:
      - { dataset: LHCBWZMU7TEV, cfac: [NRM] }
      - { dataset: LHCBWZMU8TEV, cfac: [NRM] }

  - experiment: ATLAS
    datasets:
      - { dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB}

actions_:
  - with_cuts::theoryids::pdfs::experiments::experiment plot_fancy

```

This will first enter the "*with_cuts*" namespace (thus setting
`use_cuts="nocuts"` for the action), and then loop over all the
theories, pdfs, experiments and datasets inside each experiment (note
that when used as a namespace specification, `experiment` refers to
the list of datasets it contains).

The order over which the looping is done is significative: For one the
outer specifications must set all the variables required for the inner
to be fully resolved (so `with_cuts` must go before `experiment`).

For
other, the caching mechanism works by grouping together the namespace
specifications from the beginning. For example, suppose  we where to
add another action to the example above:
```yaml
    - with_cuts:
        theoryids:
          pdfs:
            experiments:
                experiment:
                  - plot_chi2dist
```
both of these require to compute the same convolutions. Validphys will
realize this as long as both actions are iterated in the same way.
However permuting "pdfs" and "theoryids" would result in the
convolutions computed twice, since the code cannot prove that they
would be identical.


 - Always loop from more general to more specific.

 - Always loop in the same way.

### Action arguments

Action arguments are syntactic sugar for specifying arguments visible
to a single actions. They are subject to being verified by the action
defined checks. For example, in the PDF plotting example above:

```yaml
pdfs:
    - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
    - NNPDF30_nnlo_as_0118
    - CT14nlo

first:
    Q: 1
    flavours: [up, down, gluon]

second:
    Q: 100
    xgrid: linear

actions_:
  - first::plot_pdfreplicas (normalize_to=NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118)
  - first plot_pdfs
  - second plot_pdfreplicas
```

The `normalize_to` key only affects the `plot_pdfreplicas` action.
Note that defining it inside the `first` mapping would have had the
same effect in this case.


### The `from_` special key

The `from_` specifies that the value of a resource is to be taken from
a container. This is useful for working with fits (but not limited to
that). For example:

```yaml
fit: 161208-jr-003

use_cuts: "nocuts"

description:
    from_: fit

theory:
    from_: fit

theoryid:
    from_: theory


Q: 10

template: report.md

normalize:
    normalize_to: 1

datanorm:
    normalize_to: data

pdfs:
    - from_: fit
    - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
experiments:
    from_: fit

actions_:
   - report(out_filename=index.md)

```

Here the `from_` key is used multiple times:

 - To obtain the description string from the report input card.

 - To obtain the theory mapping from the fit input card.

 - To obtain the theoryid key from the theory mapping.

 - To obtain a single PDF produced in the fit (as an element of the
	 list/namespaces of pdfs). Note that the keyword is also allowed
	 inside nested elements.

 - To obtain a set of all the experiments of the fit.

The `from_` key respects lazy processing, and therefore something like
this will do what you expect:

```yaml
fits:
    - 161208-jr-003
    - 161222-jr-004


use_cuts: "nocuts"

theory:
    from_: fit

theoryid:
    from_: theory


Q: 10

description:
    from_: fit
template: report.md

normalize:
    normalize_to: 1

datanorm:
    normalize_to: data

pdfs:
    - from_: fit
    - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
experiments:
    from_: fit

actions_:
  - fits report
```
This will work exactly as the example above, except that a new action
(with its corresponding different set of resources) will be generated
for each of the two fits.

For fits, there is a shortcut to set `experiments`, `pdf` and
`theoryid` to the values obtained from the fit. This can be done with
the `fitcontext` rule. The above example can be simplified like this:

```yaml
fits:
    - 161208-jr-003
    - 161222-jr-004


use_cuts: "nocuts"


Q: 10

description:
    from_: fit
template: report.md

normalize:
    normalize_to: 1

datanorm:
    normalize_to: data

pdfs:
    - from_: fit
    - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118

actions_:
  - fits::fitcontext report
```

Note that one still needs to set manually other keys like `description` and `pdfs`.

#### from_: Null

As a special case, `from_: Null` will retrieve the variable from the
current namespace. This comes handy to transform lists of items into
other items. Consider for example:

```yaml
base:
    fit: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_1000


pairs:
    fits:
        - from_: base
        - from_: null

fits:
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_30dataset
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_collider
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_noAWZrap11
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_nojets
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_noLHCb
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_noLHC
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_nonuclear
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_notop
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_noZpt
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_proton
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_wAZPT7TEV
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_wCMSDY12
    - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_wEMC

use_cuts: "fromfit"

printopts:
    print_common: False

    % Non-default datasets

    The datasets are compared to the default `{@base fit@}` fit.

    {@with fits::fitcontext@}
    {@fit@}
    ======

    {@description@}

    {@with pairs@}

    {@printopts print_dataset_differences  @}
    {@print_different_cuts@}

    {@endwith@}
    {@endwith@}

actions_:
  - report(main=True, mathjax=True)

```

At the beginning, we are printing the name of the fit contained in
`base`.  Then we are iterating over each of the `fits` (that we
defined explicitly in the config), and using `fitcontext` to set some
variables inside the `with` block. In the inner block `{@with
pairs@}`, we are making use of the definition of `pairs` to set the
`fits` variable to contain two fits: the one defined in `base` and the
one that changes with each iteration. Because the actions
`print_dataset_differences` and `print_different_cuts` are inside that
`with` block, the value of the variable `fits` they see is precisely
this pair, which supersedes our original definition, inside that
block.


### The `namespaces_` special key

The `namespaces_` key can be used to form a list of namespaces in
a similar way as with the `{@with@}` block in the report(see [Report
template specification]). A key difference is that the `namespaces_`
block allows the list to be names, and in this way it can interact
with providers expecting a complex input structure (see in particular
[General data specification: The dataspec API]). The namespace
elements are separated by `::` and have the same meaning as in the
report.  Consider the following example:

```yaml
dataspec_input:
  - fitdeclarations:
       - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0117_uncorr
       - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_uncorr
    fits_computed_psedorreplicas_chi2_output: new-alldata/fits_matched_pseudorreplicas_chi2_table.csv
    fits_chi2_paramfits_output: new-alldata/central_global.csv
    badspecs:
       - badcurves: discard
         speclabel: "Global, discard"
       - badcurves: allminimum
         speclabel: "Global, allminimum"

  - fitdeclarations:
       - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0117_uncorr_collider
       - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_uncorr_collider
    fits_computed_psedorreplicas_chi2_output: new-alldata/collider.csv
    fits_chi2_paramfits_output: new-alldata/collider_central.csv
    badspecs:
       - badcurves: discard
         speclabel: "Collider, discard"
       - badcurves: allminimum
         speclabel: "Collider, allminimum"

dataspecs:
    namespaces_: "dataspec_input::badspecs
                  ::fits_as_from_fitdeclarations::fits_name_from_fitdeclarations
                  ::use_fits_computed_psedorreplicas_chi2_output::use_fits_chi2_paramfits_output"

meta:
   author: Zahari Kassabov
   title: Summary of the allminimum and discard for global and collider only fits
   keywords: [as]
template_text: |

    We compare the results of the determinations with `allminimum`
    and `discard` on the global and collider only fits.

    # Table

    {@dataspecs_as_value_error_table@}

    # Plot

    {@plot_dataspecs_as_value_error@}

actions_:
  - report(main=True)

```

Here we are generating a list of namespaces called `dataspecs` which
the actions `dataspecs_as_valie_error_table` and
`plot_dataspecs_as_value_error` expect as an input, starting from the
product of each of the two elements in the `dataspec_input` list and
its corresponding `badspecs` inner namespace, so that we have four
namespaces in total, labeled "Global, discard", "Global, allminimum",
"Collider, discard" and "Collider, allminimum". We are further
applying production rules (see [Configuration]) to extract the
information we need from the fit names and input files, producing the
corresponding values inside the correct `dataspecs` entry.

The whole list namespace is then passed as input to the actions (which
are implemented using [the collect function]).

This advanced functionality allows us to generate almost arbitrary
inputs in a declarative way and using very few primitives, at the cost
of a bit of learning curvature.


Currently the `namespaces_` functionality is restricted to generating
namespaces that are used at top level.


### Plotting labels

Several resources (PDFs, theories, fits) support a short form where
one specifies the ID required to recover the resource (e.g. LHAPDF ID,
theory ID and fit folder respectively) and also form where a plotting
layer is specified together with the ID. For example:
```yaml
pdfs:
    - id:  160502-r82cacd2-jr-001
      label: Baseline

    - id: 160502-r82cacd2-jr-008
      label: HERA+LHCb

    - id: 160603-r654e559-jr-003
      label: baseline+LHCb and Tev legacy
```

In all plots the label will be used everywhere the PDF name needs to
be displayed (like in legends and axes).

The plotting labels for datasets are read from the `dataset_label` key
in the plotting files (See [Plotting
format specification](plotting_format.html)).

Reports
-------

Reports are implemented as an action of `reportengine` (admittedly a
little hacky at the moment). The `report` action takes a `template`
argument, corresponding to the filename of a template in the [Pandoc
Markdown format](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown), with
the actions defined with a special syntax discussed below. The actions
will be resolve as if they where directly specified in the
configuration file and when all of them are completed, their value
will be substituted in the template (the `jinja2` library is used for
the intermediate rendering).

### Report template specification

`reportengine` will interpret strings between `{@` and `@}` inside the
templates. There are currently **target** and **with**/**endwith**
tags:

Target tags
~ Specify an action to be executed. The possible syntax is:
```
{@[spec] action_name[(arg1=value, arg2=value)]@}
```
where `[]` stands for optional syntax. A few conforming examples are:
```
{@ plot_fancy @}
```
```
{@theory::pdfs plot_fancy@}
```
```
{@plot_fancy(normalize_to=data)@}
```
The optional namespace specification works as described in [Multiple
inputs and namespaces]. The different parts of the specification,
naming mapping, lists of mappings (or special tags implementing that
behaviour) are separated with the `::` operator (resembling the C++
scope resolution operator). Actions will be repeated if the
specification results in multiple namespaces (e.g. one plot per pdf in
the second example above). The optional argument specification works
as described in [Action arguments].

With/endwith tags
~ Repeat the content between the tags for each namespace in the
specifications. Targets inside the block are repeated and searched
within each namespace. The syntax of the `with` tag is:
```
{@with spec@}
```
and it must be closed by an `endwith` tag
```
{@endwith@}
```
Like in the **target** tag, the spec is separated by `::`.

### The report action

As always, see `validphys --help report` for the most complete
information. The options allow customizing the CSS style or the
template that contains the report itself.

Here we only discuss a couple of interesting flags.

#### The `main` flag

The `main: True` flag can only affect one report per run. It has the
effect of setting the name `index.html`, which comes handy for
visualizing the uploaded result in the server (see [Uploading the
result]).

The main flag also tries to open the web browser when the report finishes. The
browser will be chosen according to internal heuristics, by queering system
preferences. These can be overridden by setting the `BROWSER` environment
variable. For example in text-only environments such as remote clusters, it may
be preferable to just print the URL. This can be achieved by setting the
environment variable to `echo` (for example in the `.bashrc` file):

```bash
export BROWSER=echo
```

#### Displaying math (the `mathjax` flag)

Displaying math on browsers is painful and not without trouble. Pandoc
tries to render the LaTeX math using utf8-characters. This doesn't
require external dependencies and allows to work with the text
normally, but is extremely limited (little more than subindexes and
greek letters).

It is possible to set `mathjax:True` to use the
[Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) library. This supports many more
symbols, but is rather slow and requires an external connection in
order to render the math.


### Example report template

A template that could correspond to the example above is:
```
NNPDF Report
============

{@ description  @}


PDF plots
---------

{@ plot_pdfs @}

**Normalized**

{@normalize plot_pdfs  @}


Train-valid split
------------------

{@ plot_training_validation @}

$\chi^2$
-------
{@ with pdfs  @}

### {@ pdf @}

{@ experiments_chi2_table @}

{@ endwith@}

Experiment plots
---------------
{@ with pdfs @}
###Experiment results for {@pdf@}
{@with datanorm::experiments@}

#### {@experiment@}
{@experiment plot_fancy @}
{@ endwith @}
{@ endwith @}
```

First we are writing a verbatim Markdown title. Next we are asking for
a variable named "`description`" to be computed and later substituted
right below (it is obtained from the fit config file, as seen in the
template). Then we are computing absolute and normalized PDF plots
(`normalize` is an arbitrary string that is defined in the config file
to normalize to the first PDF). We then plot the training and
validation $\chi^2$ of each replica in the fit. Next we compute the
$\chi^2$ for each experiment, and produce a separate table and heading
for each PDF in `pdfs` (note that LaTeX math syntax is allowed).
Finally we produce, for each pdf and for each experiment, a set of
data-theory comparison plots (which in turn are repeated for each
dataset in the experiment).

Information on selected tools
-----------------------------

There are too many tools that are still evolving too rapidly to
completely document in here. Refer to the automatically generated
command line help ([Seeing what actions are available]) for more
up to date documentation. Here we only cover the complex tools that
require more specific documentation.

### Specifying data cuts

The experimental `CommonData` files contain more data points than we
actually fit. Some data points are excluded for reasons such as the
instability of the perturbative expansion in their corresponding
kinematic regions.

There are four possibilities for handling the experimental cuts
within validphys, which are controlled with the `use_cuts`
configuration setting:

`use_cuts: 'nocuts'`
  ~ This causes the content of the data files to be taken unmodified.
  Note that some theory predictions may be ill defined in this
  situation.

`use_cuts: 'fromfit'`
  ~ The cuts are read from the masks given as input to `nnfit`, and
  generated by `vp-setupfit`. An existing fit is required, to load the
  cuts, and must contain the masks for all the datasets analyzed in
  the active namespace.

`use_cuts: 'internal'`
  ~ Compute the cut masks as `vp-setupfit` would do. Currently the
  parameters `q2min` and `w2min` must be given. These can in turn be
  set to the same as the fit values by loading the `datacuts`
  namespace from the fit. In this case, the cuts will normally
  coincide with the ones loaded with  the `fromfit` setting.

`use_cuts: 'fromintersection'`
  ~ Compute the internal cuts (as per `use_cuts: 'internal'`) after
  within each namespace in a [namespace list](#multiple-inputs-and-namespaces) called
  `cuts_intersection_spec` and take the intersection of the results as
  the cuts for the given dataset. This is useful for example for
  requiring the common subset of points that pass the cuts at NLO and
  NNLO.

The following example demonstrates these options:

```yaml

Here we put together the results with the different filtering policies
in a [Data theory comparison] plot and then plot the χ² distribution
for each one individually.  With these settings the later three
[dataspecs](#general-data-specification-the-dataspec-api) give the
same result.

### Data theory comparison

The name of the data-theory comparison tool is `plot_fancy`. You can
see what parameters in the runcard influence it by typing:
```
validphys --help plot_fancy
```
The basic inputs are a dataset and one or more PDFs. The way a dataset
is to be plotted is controlled by one or more PLOTTING files in the
`commondata` format. These are simple YAML files and ideally each
dataset should have them. It is possible to specify how to transform
the kinematics stored in the commondata, what to use as `x` axis or
how to group the plots. The format is described in detail in [Plotting
format specification](plotting_format.html). The plotting
specifications are supported by small amounts of Python (defining the
various transformations), which are declared in the
`validphys.plotoptions` package.

Note that PLOTTING files are considered part of `nnpdfcpp`, and as
such they are assumed to be correct, so in principle they have not
guarantee of failing early with a good error message. However, you can
set `check_plotting: True` in the input configurations to cause the
PLOTTING files to be processed as soon as the dataset is loaded. This
can be useful while debugging the plotting files, but will cause
a noticeable delay to the startup (because the C++ DataSet objects
need to be loaded in memory). This will warn of missing plotting files
and produce early nice error messages if the configuration is not
processed correctly.

### General data specification: The dataspec API

Specifying exactly which data we want to compare is an inherently
complex problem. For example, a simple data theory-comparison plot
depends on the following variable options:

 - The name of the dataset (the `commndata` file).
 - The systematics specification (the `systype` file).
 - The theory used (the fktables and fkset files).
 - [The cuts](#specifying-data-cuts).
 - The PDF(s) entering the comparison.

Ideally we want to be able to compare arbitrary aggregates of
variations of these options. Even though there is some functionality
implemented for some specific pipelines (e.g. `fits_chi2_table`
compares the chi² of all the fitted datasets in each fit with their
corresponding PDFs and theories) it is clearly not possible to foresee
all combinations that will be needed eventually. Instead, we rely on
the capabilities offered by `reportengine` and a *convention* to
specify arbitrary inputs.

The user provides a list of *namespaces* (see [Multiple inputs and
namespaces]) called *dataspecs* and dedicated functions in `validphys`
know how to interpret it appropriately. One such function is
`plot_fancy_dataspecs`: It takes a list of `dataspecs` where all the
datasets must have the same name. For example, imagine we
want to compare the NMC dataset at NLO and NNLO using the cuts of the
NNPDF 3.1 NLO fit, with the corresponding compressed hessian 3.1 PDFs
for each theory. We would write:

```yaml
fit: NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000
use_cuts: "fromfit"

dataset_input:
    dataset: NMC

dataspecs:
    - theoryid: 52
      pdf: NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_hessian

    - theoryid: 53
      pdf: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_hessian

template_text: |
    % NLO vs NNLO comparison for {@dataset_input@}
    {@plot_fancy_dataspecs@}

actions_:
  - report(main=True)

```

This would show a comparison between the data and the PDFs convolved
with the matching fktables.

We may be interested in automatizing this comparison for all the
datasets including in both fits. This is what the production rule
`matched_datasets_from_dataspecs` is for. Essentially, it resolves
`experiments` in each of the `dataspecs` and puts the datasets with
the same name together  by taking the intersection, so that actions
such as `plot_fancy_dataspecs` can act on it (it output an inner
`dataspec` list containing the appropriate keys). While the mechanism
is complicated (you can see more details with `valdiphys --help
config`), the resulting input cards are simple and powerful. It boils
down to:

```yaml
use_cuts: "fromfit"

experiments:
    from_: fit

dataspecs:
    - theoryid: 52
      pdf: NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_hessian
      speclabel: "NLO"
      fit: NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000

    - theoryid: 53
      pdf: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_hessian
      speclabel: "NNLO"
      fit: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_1000


meta:
    title: NLO vs NNLO results for all NLO datasets in 3.1
    keywords: [test, nn31final]
    author: Zahari Kassabov

template_text: |
    {@with matched_datasets_from_dataspecs@}
    # {@dataset_name@}

    {@plot_fancy_dataspecs@}

    {@endwith@}

actions_:
 - report(main=True)
```

Here we are taking the experiments and cuts from a different fit,
using the appropriate cfactors (the `dataspecs` list provides the fits
from which the variables are taken), putting the datasets with the
same name together (the `matched_datasets_from_dataspecs` production
rule) and writing a title and the data-theory comparison plots for
each dataset in the intersection (the actions inside the `with`
block).

### Processing closure test data

When analyzing closure tests (see the [NNPDF 3.0] paper), we typically want to
refer to the *fake* closure data, rather at the original experimental
data. The configuration option `use_fitcommondata: True` serves this
purpose.

When starting a fit (with `vp-setupfit`) currently CommonData
files are copied to the output folder. For normal fits,
these correspond to the usual CommonData files stored in the data
folder. For closure test fits, the CommonData files correspond to the
fake data, generated based on the underlying PDF.

Setting the `use_fitcommondata` key to `True` causes the actions
declared within some [namespace] causes the actions in that namespace
to look for CommonData files in the fit output folder (it is thus
required that a fit is specified that contains the desired
CommonData). For closure test fits, this will have the effect of
making actions data-theory comparisons or chi² (and indeed everything
that uses experimental data) compare with the fake data rather than
the experimental data. It should make no difference for the normal
fits, unless the CommonData files have changed between the installed
version of the code and the fit. This is typically discouraged.

For example, the following runcard takes a closure test fit and its
corresponding reference fit and produces a plot of the experimental
χ². In both cases the CommonData files are read from the corresponding
fit folder (because we set `use_fitcommondata: True` at the top
level). For the reference fit, this will cause the theory predictions
to be compared with the original experimental data, while in the
closure test data, predictions will be compared to the fake data. This
is typically the relevant comparison.

```yaml
meta:
    title: Example using use_fitcommondata
    author: Zahari Kassanov
    keywords: test

use_fitcommondata: True
use_cuts: "fromfit"

fits:
  - {id: 180501-nh-004, label: "Closure fit"}
  - {id: 180307-nh-001, label: "Reference fit"}

actions_:
  - plot_fits_datasets_chi2
```

### The vp-comparefits application

While `validphys` provides the flexibility to produce analyses that
are specific for the task at hand, it is sometimes useful to run a
standardized set of comparisons, which can be easily integrated in a
production workflow.

The script `vp-comparefits` produces a comparison between a *base fit*
that we are mainly interested in analyzing and a *reference fit* we
want to compare it with. The script will produce a report detailing
the statistical estimators, display PDF comparisons at various scales
or compare the theory predictions.

The basic usage is:

```bash
vp-comparefits -i
```

Where the `-i` option stands for `--interactive` and it will cause the
script to ask the user for the parameters of the comparison.
Specifically users need to provide the base and reference fits, as
well as the metadata parameters required to index the report
(including author, title and keywords); see [Metadata Indexing].  All
these options can be set via command line parameters, and this must be
done for non interactive usage (without the `-i` option). Additionally
all the relevant command line arguments of `validphys` work in the
same way. See `vp-comparefits --help` for details.


The `vp-comparefits` script is a thin wrapper around a `validphys`
runcard stored under `comparefittemplates/comparecard.yaml` in the
source code. That runcard (and its associated templates) can be
modified to improve the default comparison.

### Fit renaming

Fits can be renamed from the command line application `fitrename` that comes installed
with validphys. Basic usage requires the user to enter the path to the fit along with the desired
new name for the fit.

For example, suppose one wishes to locally rename the fit `181109-si-nlo-central_DISonly`
located in the current directory's parent. Then one can rename this fit to `new_name` using

```
$ fitrename ../181109-si-nlo-central_DISonly new_name
```

If the user wishes to retain a copy of the original fit, they can do so with the optional
`-c` flag. For example:

```
$ fitrename -c ../181109-si-nlo-central_DISonly new_name
```

Will result in a fit named `181109-si-nlo-central_DISonly` and a copy named `new_name` in the 
original directory.

However, by default, fits that are download with `vp-get fit` will be located in the NNPDF results
directory. This is usually located in `~/miniconda3/envs/<nnpdf env>/share/NNPDF/results`. Fits 
located in this directory can be renamed with the `-r` flag. 

As an example, suppose the fit `181109-si-nlo-central_DISonly` is located in the NNPDF results directory.
It can be renamed, irrespective of the current working directory, using 

```
$ fitrename -r 181109-si-nlo-central_DISonly new_name
```

A copy of the original fit can be created in the results directory using the `-rc` flag. It is important to
note if the `-r` flag is used, then the input fit should not be a path, but simply the fit name; otherwise an
error is raised.

In addition, errors will be raised if the input directory is not a valid fit (for example, if it is missing the
`filter.yml` runcard) or if the requested new fit name already exists.

If the user wishes to add their own, non-standard files, then it is advisable to avoid using the fit name in these
files as the `fitrename` command will also rename these files.

### Fits with a Theory Covariance Matrix

Fits can be ran with a contribution to the covarince matrix obtained from
performing scale variations. `validphys` also has flags which control the how
whether the covariance matrix used to calculate statistical estimators should
include a contribution from the theory covariance matrix. Getting the various
flags that control these behaviours correct in both fit and `validphys` runcards
is critical to getting sensible results. Examples with explanation will be
provided here to demonstrate how to run a fit with a theory covariance matrix
and then use the various `validphys` analysis tools on the fit.

#### Running a fit with Theory Covariance Matrix

In order to run a fit with a theory covariance the user must first specify that
`datasets` are all part of the same `experiment`. An example of how this is done
in practise is provided with the `experiments` section of a DIS only fit
runcard:

```yaml
experiments:
- experiment: BIGEXP
  datasets:
  - {dataset: NMCPD, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: NMC, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: SLACP, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: SLACD, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: BCDMSP, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: BCDMSD, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: CHORUSNU, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: CHORUSNB, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: NTVNUDMN, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: NTVNBDMN, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: HERACOMBNCEM, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: HERACOMBNCEP460, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: HERACOMBNCEP575, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: HERACOMBNCEP820, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: HERACOMBNCEP920, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: HERACOMBCCEM, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: HERACOMBCCEP, frac: 0.5}
  - {dataset: HERAF2CHARM, frac: 0.5}
```

The `datasets` must be part of the same single `experiment` for the theory
covariance matrix which is generated when the user runs `vp-setupfit` to be
compatible with the fitting infrastructure.

The next step is to specify the `theorycovmatconfig`. This namespace controls
which point prescription is used to generate the theory covariance matrix, and
whether the theory covariance matrix will be used in the sampling of the
pseudodata, the fitting of the data or both.

The different prescriptions for scale variation are 3-point, 5-point,
5bar-point, 7-point and 9-point, depending on which presciption the user decides
to use, they must provide the correct number and combination of `theoryids`. In
addition to this if 5 or 5bar is being used then the user must specify which of
these prescriptions to use with the `fivetheories` flag. There are also two
options for the 7-point presciption, the default is 'Gavin's' prescription but
the user can also specify `seventheories: original`.

The various configuration options might seem overwhelming, so for each of the
presciptions the appropriate `theoryids` and additional flags required are
provided below, ready to be pasted into a report runcard.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 3-point

```yaml
theorycovmatconfig:
  theoryids:
  - 163
  - 180
  - 173

```

##### 5-point

```yaml
theorycovmatconfig:
  theoryids:
  - 163
  - 177
  - 176
  - 179
  - 174
  fivetheories: nobar

```

##### 5bar-point

```yaml
theorycovmatconfig:
  theoryids:
  - 163
  - 180
  - 173
  - 175
  - 178
  fivetheories: bar

```

##### 7-point original

```yaml
theorycovmatconfig:
  theoryids:
  - 163
  - 177
  - 176
  - 179
  - 174
  - 180
  - 173
  seventheories: original
```

##### 7-point Gavin (default)

```yaml
theorycovmatconfig:
  theoryids:
  - 163
  - 177
  - 176
  - 179
  - 174
  - 180
  - 173

```

##### 9-point

```yaml
theorycovmatconfig:
  theoryids:
  - 163
  - 177
  - 176
  - 179
  - 174
  - 180
  - 173
  - 175
  - 178
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the user has correctly specified the `theoryids` and additional flags for
their chosen prescription then the user must specify which PDF will be used to
generate the theory 'points' required to construct the theory covariance matrix.
The user must additionally specify where the theory covariance is to be used.
The theory covariance can be used to sample the pseudodata by setting
`use_thcovmat_in_sampling: true`, likewise the theory covariance can be included
in covariance matrix used in the fit by specifying
`use_thcovmat_in_fitting: true`.
The user can choose what kind of theory covariance matrix should be used in the
fit, by setting the flag `thcovmat_type ` to be one among 
`full, blockdiagonal, diagonal`. If the flag does not appear in the runcard
the full theory covariance matrix is used by default.

Combining all of the above information, if one wanted to run a fit using the
theory covariance, calculated using the 9-point prescription, in both the
fitting and sampling with `NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118` used to generate the
covariance matrix then the complete `theorycovmatconfig` would be:

```yaml
theorycovmatconfig:
  theoryids:
  - 163
  - 177
  - 176
  - 179
  - 174
  - 180
  - 173
  - 175
  - 178
  pdf: NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118
  use_thcovmat_in_fitting: true
  use_thcovmat_in_sampling: true
```

#### Using `validphys` statistical estimators with theory covariance

Once a fit has been ran with the theory covariance, it is necessary to use the
theory covariance matrix in estimators such as calculating the chi² in order to
get meaningful values. This behaviour is controlled by the flag
`use_thcovmat_if_present`, which by default the flag is set to `False`.

If the user specifies `use_thcovmat_if_present: True` then they must also
specify a corresponding `fit`. The configuration file for that `fit` will be
read. If `use_thcovmat_in_fitting: True` then validphys will locate the theory
covariance matrix used during the fit and add it to the experimental
covariance matrix, for use in statistical estimators such as chi². A simple
example of this would be

```yaml
dataset_input: {dataset: HERAF2CHARM}

use_thcovmat_if_present: True

fit: 190310-tg-nlo-global-7pts

use_cuts: "fromfit"

pdf:
  from_: fit

theory:
  from_: fit

theoryid:
  from_: theory

actions_:
    - dataset_chi2_table
```

It should be noted that any `dataset_input` specified in the same runcard that
`use_thcovmat_if_present: True` must have been fitted in the corresponding
`fit`. If the corresponding fit has `use_thcovmat_if_present: False` then the
user will be warned and there will be no contribution from the theory covariance
matrix used in calculating statistical estimators for that runcard.

When using the `vp-comparefits` application, the user **must** either specify
the commandline flag `--thcovmat_if_present` or `--no-thcovmat_if_present`
which set `use_thcovmat_if_present` to `True` or `False` respectively.

If the user uses the interactive mode, `vp-comparefits -i`, then they will be
prompted to select whether or not to use the theory covariance matrix, if
available, in the report if they have not already specified on the command line.

Parallel mode
-------------

It is possible to run validphys using all the available cores in the
system. This is done simply using the `--parallel` flag. This will
result in a performance gain for many run configurations. The parallel
mode will be eventually enabled by default, and you can disable it
explicitly with the `--no-parrallel` flag.

The environment variable `MAX_WORKER_PROCESSES` can be used to
control the maximum number of workers, which defaults to the total cpu
count.

Downloading resources
---------------------

By default theories, fits and PDFs that are required will be
downloaded automatically. PDFs are searched both in LHAPDF and in our
custom fits, as well as in a specific location in the server.

The remote downloading functionality can
be controlled with the `--net` (no effect by default) and `--no-net`
(disable all remote downloading) options.  Because defaults could
change in the future, it is useful that scripts calling validphys
specify this behaviour explicitly.

Additionally there is the `vp-get` utility, that can by itself download
resources in the same way `validphys` would do. The basic syntax is:

```bash
vp-get <resource_type> <resource_name>
````

The available options for `<resource type>` can be seen with `vp-get --list`.
Currently they are:

```bash
 $ vp-get --list                                                                                         (nnpdf-
Available resource types:
 - fit
 - pdf
 - theoryID
 - vp_output_file
```

For example to download the fit `NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000` we would write
```
$ vp-get fit NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000
```

If the resource is already installed, the tool will display some information on
it and bail out:

```bash
$ vp-get fit NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000
FitSpec(name='NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000', path=PosixPath('/home/zah/anaconda3/envs/nnpdf-dev/share/NNPDF/results/NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000'))
```

Uploading the result
--------------------

### Uploading to the server

When the `--upload` flag is set, the contents of the output folder
will be uploaded to the NNPDF data server, after validphys is done. An
authorized ssh key and the `rsync` program are required to use this
feature.  A URL will be displayed from which the contents are
accessible (currently password protected).

Alternatively, there is the command `vp-upload <output-folder>`, which
comes installed with validphys2. This works exactly the same as
`--upload`, but you run it on an existing output.

### Metadata indexing

All the uploaded results are automatically indexed in the server. The
metadata to index it is obtained from the following sources in order
of priority:

  - A `meta.yaml` file in the top level folder of the report. For
	example:
	```yaml
	---
    title: PDF comparisons
    author: NNPDF Collaboration
    keywords: [gallery]
	...

	```
	the keys are the same as in the [pandoc-markdown
	syntax](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks), and this
	metadata will also be used within the report (e.g. to set the
	title and the author fields). This is the recommended option for
	top level metadata.  The `meta.yaml` file can be generated
	verbatim from a `meta` mapping in the `validphys` runcard.
	For example:
    ```yaml
    meta:
        title: PDF comparisons
        author: NNPDF Collaboration
        keywords: [gallery]
    ```
	would yield the same file as above.

  - An `index.html` file in the uploaded output folder. To automatically
    generate an `index.html` file from a `report` action, one may set the
    option `main:True` (alternatively there is the `out_filename` option,
    which may be used to specify the filename). In the template, use
    the [pandoc-markdown
    syntax](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks) to set the
    metadata at the top of the file. In the runcard you would write:

    ~~~yaml
    template: mytemplate.md
    actions_:
      - report(main=True)
    ~~~
    and you would begin `mytemplate.md`, using YAML syntax,  like:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: Testing the fit {@fit@}
    author: Zahari Kassabov
    keywords: [nnpdf31, nolhc]
    ...
    ```
    Note that you can use the report syntax to get the parameters from the
    runcard. If you only want to set title or author, you can also
	prefix the two first lines of the markdown templates with `%`:
	```markdown
	% Template title
	% Myself, the template author

	Content...
	```
	This is mostly useful for sub-reports not at the top level, in
	more complicated documents.


The keywords are used for indexing and filtering. It is important to
set them properly, to aid the discoverability of the result. Some tags
may be used to display the report in a prominent place in the index
page. The source of the report index page is
```
serverscripts/WEB/validphys-reports/index.html
```
inside the `validphys2` repository. This page can be edited to reflect
the current interests (the Makefile directly uploads to the
server). See [Web Scripts] in the [Developer Documentation] for more
details.

### Uploading fits

To upload fits use:

```
vp-upload --fit <completed_fit_path>
```

Note there are [plans](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/issues/162) to change this
command.

### Uploading arbitrary files

The command `wiki-upload` is a more interactive version of
`vp-upload`, allowing to upload arbitrary files and asking the user
for the metadata for indexing. While `vp-upload` is faster and more
suitable for usage in scripts, casual users might find `wiki-upload`
easier to use.

Seeing the input
----------------

By default, validphys will copy the input YAML configuration, as well
as any processed templates to a `input` folder inside the target
output folder. The goal is to make any result reproducible by typing
`validphys <report folder>/input/runcard.yaml`. For the fits uploaded
to the server, it is possible to access the input files by appending
`/input` to the URL.


Figure formats
--------------

The output figure formats can be controlled with the `--formats`
option. The available formas depend on the underlying implementation.
On Linux with Anaconda, they are:
```
png: Portable Network Graphics
pdf: Portable Document Format
ps: Postscript
jpg: Joint Photographic Experts Group
rgba: Raw RGBA bitmap
eps: Encapsulated Postscript
tiff: Tagged Image File Format
raw: Raw RGBA bitmap
svg: Scalable Vector Graphics
pgf: PGF code for LaTeX
tif: Tagged Image File Format
svgz: Scalable Vector Graphics
jpeg: Joint Photographic Experts Group
```

The `--formats` option accepts more than one format. However if an
HTML report is desired, one should make sure that the *first* format
is browser friendly and can be displayed nicely without plugins (from
the formats above, the browser friendly ones would be png, jpg, and
svg).

Plotting style
--------------

Many of the options of matplotlib (the library we for plotting) can be
controlled with a plotting style file. To customize (or "*improve*")
the looks of the plots, you can edit the validphys style
`src/validphys/small.mplstlye` or pass your own style file with the
`--style` option.

Controlling displayed messages
------------------------------

By default we try to only display useful information that the user
should definitively read. In case something is not working correctly,
debug messages can be enabled with the `-d` (or `--debug`) flag. More
messages can be suppressed using the `-q` (or `--quiet`) flags.
Additionally the messages from libnnpdf can be controlled with the
`--cout`/`--no-cout` flags (by default the output is displayed only
when the debug flag is enabled).


Developer documentation
=======================

`validphys2` aims to be as simple to understand and extend as
possible. The code is based on self contained Python functions with
a couple of magic decorators that make `reportengine` work as
expected. Based on that, there is a large and ever growing set of
tools to interact with NNPDF resources, that are spread across several
modules in the codebase. Some of the most important are:

`validphys.core`

:   Core data structures that represent objects such as PDFs and data
    sets. Several of them map to `libnnpdf` objects. In that case they
	have a `.load()` method that produces the corresponding `C++`
	object.

`validphys.loader`

:  Tools to obtain NNPDF resources locally or remotely. See [Validphys
   Loaders].

`validphys.config`

:   Defines how resources are to be parsed from the configuration
    file. This is largely using `validphys.loader`.

`vlidphys.results`

:   Implements tools to store and manipulate results from data and
    theory predictions.

`validphys.gridvalues`, `validphys.bases`, `validphys.pdfgrids`

:   These contain tools to evaluate PDFs over grids of points.
    `validphys.gridvalues` contains low level functionality that uses
	`libnnpdf`, `validphys.pdfbases` contain several different bases
	over PDF flavour space and functionality to manipulate them, and
	`validphys.pdfgrids` contains high level providers suitable for
	using for plotting and as an input to other computations.

`validphys.plotoptions`

:   Tools for interpreting the dataset PLOTTING files, including the
    transformations on the kinematics and the data.

`validphys.fitdata`

:   Contains parsers for various files produced by `nnfit` along with
    tools to manipulate and display them.

`validphys.checks`

:   Contains `reportengine`-style checks that are used in several
    places. See [Checking providers].


These are used as a basis for doing everything else. We discuss how to
implement new functionality, along with many features of the framework
in [Defining custom pipelines].

Unfortunately the objective of making `validphys` easy means that the
complexity of getting things to just work is translated into
`reportengine`, which instead uses many advanced python features, and
results in a codebase that is not particularly simple.

Reportengine namespaces specifications
--------------------------------------

A central concept to how reportengine works is namespaces and
namespace specifications.
A namespace is
a [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) of
python dictionaries indexed by a tuple called *namespace specification
(nsspec)*. Nsspecs are generated from user input given in terms of
*fuzzyspecs*. This is mostly an advanced internal implementation
detail, but it is important in order to understand how several
features work. Also the abstraction leaks into user facing features
such as [The collect function].


### Namespace specifications

An nsspec is a tuple of an arbitrary number of elements.  Each element
in the tuple corresponds to one extra stack layer in depth (*"stack
frame"*). The elements of the tuple can be either:

 - Names of mappings.

 - Names of objects that have an [`as_namespace`
	 method](#the-as_namespace-method).

 - Tuples of the form (name of list of mappings, index).

The scope rules are similar to those of C: The lookup of a value is
done first looking at the inner frame and then at the outer ones,
until a match is found.

Consider the example:

```yaml

first:
   pdf: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
   normalize_to: None
   use_cuts: "nocuts"

second:
   pdf: CT14nlo
   normalize_to: CT14nlo

cutspecs:
 - {use_cuts: "nocuts"}
 - {use_cuts: "fromfit"}

```

Given the input above, we could form the following `nsspec`.
```python
('second', ('cutspecs', 0))
```
This would correspond to a namespace where we have the following
symbols available:

- `use_cuts` (set to `"nocuts"`) from `cutspecs`.

- `pdf` and `normalize_to` (set to CT) from `second`.

- `first`, `second` and `cutspecs` from the root namespace.

We could also form the specification:

```python
(('cutspecs', 1), 'first')
```
Because the innermost specification is last, the value of `use_cuts`
is `"nocuts"`.


The function `reportengine.namespaces.resolve(ns, nsspec)` returns
a mapping (in particular it is a modified version of
`collections.ChainMap`) that  implements exactly this behaviour. It is
used extensively thorough `reportengine`.

### Fuzzyspecs

The namespace specifications as described above is not what
the user typically enters. Instead the typical user input is what in
the code is labeled *fuzzyspec*. A fuzzyspec is like a nsspec except
that the lists of mappings are entered by name and not by a tuple
(name, index). A fuzzyspec resolves to one or more nsspecs. For
example, given the fuzzyspec:
```python
('second', 'cutspecs')
```
and the input above, it gets expanded into two nsspecs:
```python
('second', ('cutspecs', 0))
('second', ('cutspecs', 1))
```
corresponding to each of the two mappings in cutspecs.

### The `as_namespace` method

An object can customize how to be viewed as a reportengine namespace.
This is done by defining a method called `as_namespace`, that takes no
arguments and should return either a mapping or a list of mappings.
This is used to implement [Automatically parsing lists].

Resolving dependencies
-----------------------

Dependencies are resolved automatically by `reportengine` when the
client applications follow a certain convention.

A few things that Validphys needs to do (see [Design considerations])
are:

 - Provide a declarative interface where the user specifies only the
   amount of information needed to specify the requirements.

 - Be usable as a normal Python library.

 - Reuse the computations that are common to several actions.

In order to do all that, one declares "provider modules" (which is
done in `validphys.app`), which are nothing but normal Python files
containing functions (and thus can be used as a library). The
convention in `reportengine` is that a parameter with the same name as
a provider function specifies that that function is a dependency.

Imagine we want to have two plotting tools `plot1` and `plot2`, each
of which takes as an argument the result of the same computation,
`results`, which in turn need a PDF set entered by the user to be
computed. One would declare the functions as follows:
```python
def results(pdf):
    #Compute the results
	...

def plot1(results):
    #Take the result and produce a plot of type 1.
    ...

def plot2(results):
    #Take the result and produce a plot of type 2.
    ...
```

Then, an input card like the following:
```yaml
pdf: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118

actions_:
  - plot1
  - plot2
```
Would result in the following DAG:

![Simple dependency resolution](simplegraph.png)

The important point to note is that parameter names determine the
dependencies by default.

To address the inflexibility that results from the way we choose to
automatically assign dependency, each action is assigned a unique
[Namespace specification](#namespace-specifications). This allows to
specify actions with several different parameters. Let's make the
example above more complicated:
```python
def results(pdf):
    #Compute the results
	...

def plot1(results, parameter):
    #Take the result and produce a plot of type 1.
    ...

def plot2(results, parameter):
    #Take the result and produce a plot of type 2.
    ...
```

We can request a parameter scan like this:

```yaml
pdf: NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118

scan_params:
  - parameter: 5
  - parameter: 10
  - parameter: 20


actions_:
  - scan_params plot1
  - scan_params plot2
```
which would result in the following computation:

![Parameter scan](params.png)

We have requested the two plots to be computed once in each of the
three namespaces spanned by `scan_params`. The actions are in general
**not** computed in the requested namespace, but rather in the
*outermost one that satisfies all the dependencies* (there is also
a unique private stack frame per action not shown in the figures
above). That's why, in the graph above, `results` appears only once:
Since it doesn't depend on the value of `parameter` (it doesn't appear
in its signature), it is computed in the root namespace, rather than
once in each of the `scan_params` namespaces. If we instead had this:
```yaml
pdfs:
 - NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118
 - CT14nlo

scan_params:
  - parameter: 5
  - parameter: 10


actions_:
  - pdfs::scan_params plot1
```

The corresponding graph would be:

![Dependency levels](twoparams.png)

since `results` does depend on the pdf.


Defining custom pipelines
-------------------------

Here we discuss what needs to go from user entered strings in the YAML
file plots and reports.

The basic code flow is as follows:

 1. The `actions_` key is parsed to obtain a list of requirements with
	their associated [fuzzyspec](#fuzzyspecs).

 2. Each requirement spans other requirements. These can be:
    - Providers: Other functions with requirements on their own.
	- User input processed by the [Configuration], which is
	  immediately tested for correctness.
	- Production rules, also derived from the configuration.

 3. Once the requirements are satisfied for a given provider, the
	[checks](#checking-providers) of the provider are executed.

 4. If all the checks pass, all the runtime requirements are executed
	in such an order that the dependencies are resolved.

### Configuration

A configuration class derived from `reportengine.ConfigParser` is used to parse the
user input. In validphys, it is defined in `validphys.Config`.

The parsing in reportengine is *context dependent*. Because we want to
specify resources as much as possible before computing anything (at
"*compile time*"), we need to have some information about other
resources (e.g. theory folders) in order to do any meaningful
processing.

The `Config` class takes the user input and the dependencies and:

 - Returns a valid resource if the user input is valid.

 - Raises a `ConfigError` if the user input is invalid.

To parse a given user entered key (e.g. `posdataset`), simply define
a `parse_posdataset` function. The first argument (i.e. second after
`self`) will be the raw value in the configuration file. Any other
arguments correspond to dependencies that are already resolved at the
point where they are passed to the function (`reportengine` takes care
of that).

For example, we might have:
```python
def parse_posdataset(self, posset:dict, * ,theoryid):
    ...
```


The type specification (`:dict` above) makes sure that the user input
is of that type before it is seen by the function (which avoids
a bunch of repetitive error checking). A positivity dataset requires
a theory ID in order to be meaningfully processed (i.e. to find the
folder where the fktables are) and therefore the theoryid will be
looked for and processed first.

We need to document what the
resource we are providing does. The docstring will be seen in
`validphys --help config`:
```python
def parse_posdataset(self, posset:dict, * ,theoryid):
    """An observable used as positivity constrain in the fit.
    It is a mapping containing 'dataset' and 'poslambda'."""
    ...
```

#### Production rules

Apart from `parse_` functions, which take an explicit user input from
the corresponding key (and optionally a set of dependencies), there
are the `produce_` functions, which take only the dependencies. Other
than not taking the user input, the `produce_` functions work in
a very similar way to the `parse_` functions: They are resolved at
*"compile time"*, before any procider function is executed, and  they
should raise a `ConfigError` if they fail.

In general production rules should be preferred to parse functions
that bundle together various dependencies (e.g. data, cuts and
theory), because by having more granular elements, we can iterate over
them in different ways: For examples we might want to generate
a separate report page for each of the positivity datasets, where they
are compared for multiple theories. We could break the parse function
above into:

```python
def parse_posdataset_input(self, posset:dict):
    ...

def produce_posdataset(posdataset_input, *, theoryid):
   ...
```

Now the user has to enter a key called "posdataset_input", from which
some Python object will be obtained as the return value of
`parse_posdataset_inout`. Then, `produce_posdataset` is used to an
object representing the positivity set and the corresponding FKTables
in a given theory is obtained from the output of
`parse_posdataser_input` and a theory ID.

#### Automatically parsing lists

It is possible to easily process list of elements once the parsing for
a single element has been defined. Simply add an `eleement_of`
decorator to the parsing function defined in the Config class:
```python
@element_of('posdatasets')
def parse_posdataset(self, posset:dict, * ,theoryid):
```

Now `posdatasets` is parsed as a list of positivity datasets, which
can be passed together to a provider, or iterated over, (for example
with a `with` tag in the report, see [Report template specification]).

Note that you can also put together results from evaluating providers
using [the collect function], which can be used to map computations
over the lists described here.



#### Validphys loaders

In `validphys`, we use a `Loader` class to load resources from various
folders. It is good to have a common interface, since it is used to
list the available resources of a given type or even download
a missing resource. The functions of type `check_<resource>` should
take the information processed by the Config class anf verify that
a given resources is correct. If so they should return a "Resouce
specification" (something typically containing metadata information
such as paths, and a `load()` method to get the C++ object from
`libnnpdf`). We also define a `get` method that returns the C++ object
directly (although I am not sure it's very useful anymore).

In the case of the positivity set, this is entirely given in terms of
existing check functions:

```python
def check_posset(self, theiryID, setname, postlambda):
    cd = self.check_commondata(setname, 0)
    fk = self.check_fktable(theiryID, setname, [])
    th =  self.check_theoryID(theiryID)
    return PositivitySetSpec(cd, fk, postlambda, th)

def get_posset(self, theiryID, setname, postlambda):
    return self.check_posset(theiryID, setname, postlambda).load()
```

A more complicated example should raise the appropriate loader
errors (see the other examples in the class).

The `PositivytySetSpec` could be defined roughly like:
```python
 class PositivitySetSpec():
     def __init__(self, commondataspec, fkspec, poslambda, thspec):
         self.commondataspec = commondataspec
         self.fkspec = fkspec
         self.poslambda = poslambda
         self.thspec = thspec

     @property
     def name(self):
         return self.commondataspec.name

     def __str__(self):
         return self.name

     @functools.lru_cache()
     def load(self):
         cd = self.commondataspec.load()
         fk = self.fkspec.load()
         return PositivitySet(cd, fk, self.poslambda)
```
Here `PositivitySet` is the `libnnpdf` object. It is generally better
to pass around the spec objects because they are lighter and have more
information (e.g. the theory in the above example).

With this, our parser method could look like this:
```python

def parse_posdataset(self, posset:dict, * ,theoryid):
    """An observable used as positivity constrain in the fit.
    It is a mapping containing 'dataset' and 'poslambda'."""
    bad_msg = ("posset must be a mapping with a name ('dataset') and "
               "a float multiplier(poslambda)")

    theoryno, theopath = theoryid
    try:
        name = posset['dataset']
        poslambda = float(posset['poslambda'])
    except KeyError as e:
        raise ConfigError(bad_msg, e.args[0], posset.keys()) from e
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ConfigError(bad_msg) from e

    try:
        return self.loader.check_posset(theoryno, name, poslambda)
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        raise ConfigError(e) from e
```

The first part makes sure that the user input is of the expected form
(a mapping with a string and a number). The `ConfigError` has support
for suggesting that something could be mistyped. The syntax is
`ConfigError(message, bad_key, available_keys)`. For example, if the
user enters "poslanda" instead of "postlambda", the error message
would suggest the correct key.

Note that all possible error paths must end by raising
a `ConfigError`.



### Computing PDF dependent quantities

Now that we can receive positivity sets as input, let's do something
with them. The SWIG wrappers allow us to call the C++ methods of
`libnnpdf` from Python. These things go in the `validphys.results`
module. We can start by defining a class to produce and hold the
results:
```python
class PositivityResult(StatsResult):
    @classmethod
    def from_convolution(cls, pdf, posset):
        loaded_pdf = pdf.load()
        loaded_pos = posset.load()
        data = loaded_pos.GetPredictions(loaded_pdf)
        stats = pdf.stats_class(data.T)
        return cls(stats)

    @property
    def rawdata(self):
        return self.stats.data
```

`pdf.stats_class` allows to interpret the results of the convolution
as a function of the PDF error type (e.g. to use the different
formulas for the uncertainty of Hessian and Monte Carlo sets). In that
way it allows to abstract away the different error types. One
constructs an object inheriting from `validphys.core.Stats` that is
appropriate for a given error type by calling `pdf.stats_class(data)`
where data is an array where the entries along the first dimension are
the results from each member computed from `libnnpdf` (and the other
dimensions are arbitrary). `Stats` has methods that appropriately
collapse along the first axis. For example `central_value` computes
the mean along the first axis for Monte Carlo PDFs and yields the
first member for Hesssian PDFs.

And then define a simple provider function:
```python
def positivity_predictions(pdf, positivityset):
     return PositivityResult.from_convolution(pdf, positivityset)
```

### The collect function

In the user interface we have the possibility to perform a computation
looping over a list of namespaces. In the code, we can define
providers that collect the results of such computations with the
`collect` function.

The signature is:
```python
collect('provider_name', fuzzyspec)
```

This will expand the `fuzzyspec` relative to the current namespace and
compute the function once for each frame.  Then it will put all the
results in a list (to be iterated in the same order as the fuzzyspec)
and set that list as the result of the provider. The provider in the
first argument is found following the standard `reportengine` rules.
It can be a function defined in a provider module, a configuration
input or a production rule, as well as another `collect` provider. As
a special case, one can pass directly functions
(defined with the `def` keyword).  For example
```python
possets_predictionsa = collect(positivity_predictions, ('posdatasets',))
```

Compared to a simple `for` loop, the collect function has the
advantages that the computations are appropriately reused and several
results could be computed simultaneously in the parallel mode.

We can use the output of `collect` as input to other providers. For
example:
```python
def count_negative_points(possets_predictions):
    return np.sum([(r.rawdata < 0).sum(axis=1) for r in
	    possets_predictions], axis=0)
```

`collect` can be used to appropriately group nested inputs. For
example here is how to obtain a list of the experiments for each fit.
```python
fits_experiments = collect('experiments', ('fits',))
```

Note that `collect` always returns a flat list with the provider
evaluated for each of the namespaces spanned by the fuzzyspec. For
example
```python
fits_experiments_chi2_flat = collect(abs_chi2_data_experiment,
    ('fits', 'fitcontext', 'experiments',))
```
results in a flat list
containing the result of `abs_chi2_data_experiment` resolved for each
experiment in each fit.  One can instead retain the structure by
chaining several `collect` providers. For instance, the code
```python
experiments_chi2 = collect(abs_chi2_data_experiment, ('experiments',))
fits_experiment_chi2_data = collect('experiments_chi2', ('fits', 'fitcontext'))
```
will result in `fits_experiment_chi2_data` producing one result for
each fit, where each of them is itself list where each item result of
`abs_chi2_data_experiment` evaluated for each experiment in a given
fit.

Standard iteration techniques can be used to process the results of
collect. For example here is how we would print the χ² for each
experiment in each fit:

```python
def print_fits_experiments_chi2(
        fits, fits_experiments, fits_experiment_chi2_data):
    for fit, fit_experiments, experiments_data in zip(
            fits, fits_experiments, fits_experiment_chi2_data):
         print(f"Printing results for {fit}")
         for experiment, chi2data in zip(fit_experiments, experiments_data):
             print(f"χ² for {experiment} is ",
                f"{chi2data.central_result}/{chi2data.ndata}")
```

A minimal runcard to use the action above is:

```yaml
fits:
  - NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118
  - NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118

use_cuts: "fromfit"

actions_:
  - print_fits_experiments_chi2
```


### Checking providers

Providers can checks that verify that all the required preconditions
are met. Checks are executed at the time at which the call node is
just created and all its required dependencies are either in the
namespace or scheduled to be produced. Checking functions take the
current state of the namespace, as well as an unspecified set of other
parameters (because I haven't decided on the interface yet!).
Therefore check functions should accept `**kwargs` arguments. Checks
are decorated with the `reportengine.checks.make_argcheck` function.
If checks don't pass, they must raise
a `reportengine.checks.CheckError` exception.

For example, given a reweighting function, we may want to check that
the current PDF (the value that will be passed to the function) has
a Monte Carlo error type, we might define a check like:
```python
@make_check
def check_pdf_is_montecarlo(ns, **kwargs):
    pdf = ns['pdf']
    etype = pdf.ErrorType
    if etype != 'replicas':
        raise CheckError("Error type of PDF %s must be 'replicas' and not %s"
                          % (pdf, etype))

```

Checks can be used (abused) to modify the namespace before the action
function sees it. This can be used for some advanced context dependent
argument default setting (for example setting default file names based
on the nsspec).

The check is associated to the provider function by simply applying it
as a decorator:

```python
@check_pdf_is_montecarlo
def chi2_data_for_reweighting_experiments(pdf, args):
    ...
```

A slightly higher level interface to checks is implemented by the
`make_argcheck` decorator. Instead of receiving a namespace and other
unspecified arguments, like the functions decorated with `make_check`,
it simply takes the arguments we want to test. The function can return
a dictionary that will be used to update the namespace (but that is
not required, it can also not return anything).

For example the `check_pdf_is_montecarlo` above could be more easily
implemented like:
```python
@make_argcheck
def check_pdf_is_montecarlo(pdf):
    etype = pdf.ErrorType
    if etype != 'replicas':
        raise CheckError("Error type of PDF %s must be 'replicas' and not %s"
                          % (pdf, etype))
```
`make_argcheck` should be preferred, since it is more explicit, and
could be extended with more functionality later on. However it is
newer and not very used currently in the code.

Checks have no effect outside of reportengine (unless you call them
explicitly).

Ideally, the checks should be sufficient to guarantee that the
actions will not fail at runtime.

### Producing figures

In order to produce figures, just decorate your functions returning
`matplotlib` `Figure` objects  with the `reportengine.figure.figure`
function, e.g.:

```python
@figure
def plot_p_alpha(p_alpha_study):
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   #Plot something
   ...
   return fig
```

This will take care of the following:

 - Saving the figures with a nice, unique name to the output folder,
   in the formats specified by the user.

 - Closing the figures to save memory.

 - Making sure figures are properly displayed in reports.

There is also the `figuregen` decorator for providers that are
implemented as generators that yield several figures (see e.g. the
implementation of `plot_fancy`). Apart from just the figure, yield
a tuple (prefix, figure) where the prefix will be used in the
filename.

### Producing tables

These work similarly to [figures](#producing-figures), as described
above. Instead use the `@table` and `@tablegen` decorators.

Tables will be saved in the CSV formats.

### Customizing how things look in the report

By default, the `str()` method will be applied to objects that appear
in the report. If you want a custom behaviour, declare a declare
a custom `as_markdown` property for your objects. It should return
a string in Pandoc Markdown describing your object. Raw HTML is
also allowed (although that decreases the compatibility, e.g. if we
decide to output LaTeX instead of HTML in the future).


Python static checks and code style
-----------------------------------

We use [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) to provide static checking (e.g.
finding basic errors that a compiler would catch in compiled languages) such as
uses of unknown variable names, as well as to provide basic guidelines on the
structure of the code (e.g. avoid functions that are too complicated). Because
Pylint is way too pendantic by default, we limit the checks to only those
considered useful. The `.pylintrc` file at the top level configures Pylint to
only mind those checks. Most Python IDEs and editors have some kind of support
for pylint. It is strongly recommended to configure the editor to show the
problematic pieces of code proactively.

New code should use the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool to
format the code. This tool should not be used to aggressively reformat existing
files.


Example pull request
--------------------

You may find instructive to go though this pull request that
implements arc-length computation:

<https://github.com/NNPDF/validphys2/pull/64>

It demonstrates how to leverage existing functionality to perform new
computations and then present those as plots and tables.


Matplotlib Image Comparison Tests
---------------------------------

It is possible to create tests which perform an image comparison between a
generated plot and a preexisting baseline plot. Clearly this allows one to check
consistency in figure generation.

Before beginning you will need to ensure that you have the tests dependencies,
which can be checked in `nnpdf/conda-recipe/meta.yml`.

The next step is to write the test function. It is highly recommended to use the
validphys API for this, both to simplify the code and to make it agnostic to the
structure of backend providers - provided that they produce the same results. See
for example a function which tests the `plot_pdfs` provider:

```python
@pytest.mark.mpl_image_compare
def test_plotpdfs():
    pdfs = ['NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118']
    Q = 10
    flavours = ['g']
    #plot_pdfs returns a generator with (figure, name_hint)
    return next(API.plot_pdfs(pdfs=pdfs, Q=Q, flavours=flavours))[0]
```

we see that the function needs to return a valid matplotlib figure, and should
be decorated with `@pytest.mark.mpl_image_compare`.

Now the baseline figure needs to be generated, this can be achieved by running

```
pytest -k <name of file containing test function> --mpl-generate-path=baseline
```

which will generated a PNG of the figure in the `src/validphys/tests/baseline`
directory. It is recommended to put all baseline plots in this directory so that
they are automatically installed, and so will be in the correct location when
the CI runs the test suite.

Now that the baseline figure exists you can check that your test works:

```
pytest -k <name of file containing test function> --mpl
```

Also you can check that the test has been added to the full test suite:

```
pytest --pyargs --mpl validphys
```

just note that if you do not put the `--mpl` flag then the test will just check
that the function runs without error, and won't check that the output matches to
baseline.

Server configuration
====================

Overview
--------

The NNPDF server is a virtual machine (VM) maintained by 
the Centro Calcolo at the physics department of the 
University of Milan. The machine has 2 CPUs, 4GB of RAM, 
1 TB of disk and it is running CentOS7.

The full disk is backed up every week by the Centro Calcolo.
We perform every Sunday a `rsync` from the `/home/nnpdf` folder
to the `nnpdf@lxplus` account at CERN.

URLs
----

The URLs served by this VM are:

  - <https://data.nnpdf.science>: contain **public**
    NNPDF data such as PDF fits, releases etc.
  - <https://vp.nnpdf.science>: contains the
    `validphys` reports.
  - <https://wiki.nnpdf.science>: with
    the github wiki version.
  - <https://packages.nnpdf.science/>: The `conda` binary packages.

The domain is hosted by [Namecheap](www.namecheap.com), which also manages the
DNS entries. For each subdomain there is an A record always pointing to the same
server IP, currently 159.149.47.24. The subdomains are then handled as described
in [Web server]. For example, a DNS query for `packages.nnpdf.science` returns

```
 $ dig packages.nnpdf.science

```

Access
------

The access to the server is provided by
`ssh`/[`vp-upload`](#uploading-the-result) with the following restrictions:

- `ssh` access to `root` is forbidden.
- there is a shared `nnpdf` user with low privileges. In order to login 
the user must send his public ssh key (usually in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to SC.
The `nnpdf` is not allowed to login with password.

The `nnpdf` user shares a common `/home/nnpdf` folder 
where all NNPDF material is stored. Public access to data is 
available for all files in the `/home/nnpdf/WEB` folder. The 
`validphys` reports are stored in `/home/nnpdf/WEB/validphys-reports` 
and the wiki in `/home/nnpdf/WEB/wiki`.

The  [`conda` packages](#installing)  are automatically uploaded to the server
by the Continous Integration service (Travis), through an user called `dummy`
which has further reduction in privileges (it uses the [`rssh`
shell](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rssh)) and it is only allowed to run the
`scp` command. An accepted private key is stored securely in the [Travis
configuration](https://travis-ci.com/NNPDF/nnpdf) under the `NNPDF_SSH_KEY`
variable. It is encoded using `base64` because Travis does not easily accept
multiline variables. To use it, do something like `echo "$NNPDF_SSH_KEY" |
base64 --decode`. The packages are uploaded to `/home/nnpdf/packages`.

Web server
----------

We are using `nginx` as a lightweight and simple web server engine. The
`nginx` initial configuration depends on the linux distribution in
use. Usually debian packages provide a ready-to-go version where the
`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` is already set to work with server blocks
(subdomains).

Other distributions like CentOS7 requires more gymnastics, here some tricks:

- make sure the `/home/nnpdf` folder can be accessed by the `nginx` user
- folders served by `nginx` must have permission 755
- create 2 folders in `/etc/nginx`: `sites-available` and `sites-enabled`.
- in the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file indicate the new include path with `include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;` and remove all location statements.
- for each server block create a new file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and build a symbolic link in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.
- remember to perform a `sudo service nginx restart` or `sudo nginx -s reload` to update the server block configuration.


Finally, here an example of `nginx` configuration for the `vp.nnpdf.science` server block without ssl encryption:
```
server {
    listen  80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name vp.nnpdf.science;
    
    root /home/nnpdf/WEB/validphys-reports;
    location / {
      try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	    auth_basic "Restricted";
	    auth_basic_user_file /home/nnpdf/WEB/validphys-reports/.htpasswd;
    }

    location /thumbnails {
    	alias /home/nnpdf/WEB/thumbnails;
	    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	    auth_basic "Restricted";
      auth_basic_user_file /home/nnpdf/WEB/validphys-reports/.htpasswd;
    }
}
```

Some URLs are password protected using the HTTP `basic_auth` mechanism. This is
implemented by setting the corresponding configuration in nginx, as shown above
(specifically with the `auth_basic` and `auth_basic_user_file` keys). The
`.htpasswd` files mentioned in the configuration are generated with the
`htpasswd` tool.


SSL encryption
--------------

SSL encription is provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).
The certificates are created using the `certbot` program with the `nginx` module.

In order to create new ssl certificates, first prepare the `nginx` server block 
configuration file and then run the interactive command:
```
sudo certbot --nginx -d <domain>
```
This will ask you several questions, including if you would like to automatically
update the `nginx` server block file. We fully recommend this approach.

The certificate is automatically renewed by a [cron job](#cron-jobs).

Cron jobs
---------

The following cron jobs are registered for the `nnpdf` user:

- every day at 4 AM run the `index-email.py` script.
- at every reboot run `index-reports.py`, `index-fits.py`,
	`index-packahes-public.sh` and `index-packages-private.sh`, which monitor
  contiguously the respective folders and create indexes that can be used by
  various applications. The first two are homegrown scripts (see [Web Scripts])
  and the later two use
  [`conda-index`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/commands/conda-index.html).


The following cron jobs are registered for the `root` user:

- perform backup of `/home/nnpdf` in lxplus every Saturday at noon.
- perform a certbot renew every Monday.
- reboot every Sunday at 6am (in order to use new kernels).
- perform system update every day.


Web Scripts
-----------

Validphys2 interacts with the NNPDF server by [Downloading Resources]
and [Uploading the result].

The server scripts live in the validphys2
repository under the `serverscripts` folder.

The server side
infrastructure that makes this possible currently aims to be
minimalistic. The only thing that is done is maintaining some index
files (currently for theories, fits, reports and LHAPDF sets)
which essentially list the files in a given directory. The indexes are
regenerated automatically when their correspondent folders are
modified. This is achieved by waiting for changes using the Linux
`inotify` API and my
[`asynwatch`](https://github.com/Zaharid/asyncwatch) module.

The report index is used to display a webpage indexing the reports. It
retrieves extra information from a `meta.yaml` file in the top level
output directory, and (with lower priority) by parsing an `index.html`
page contained in the report folder. Properties like title, author and tags
are retrieved from the HTML header of this file, and are expected to
be in the same format that Pandoc would have used to write them when
`meta.yaml` is passed as a input. To produce it, the most convenient
way is setting the `main` flag of a report, as described in [Uploading
the result].

Additionally information from the mailing list is added to the index
page. Specifically we query the list for links to validphys reports
and add links to the emails next to the entries of the reports that
are mentioned. This is achieved with the `index-email.py` script. It
needs some authentication credentials to access the mailing list. The
password is stored in a file called `EMAIL_BOT_PASSWORD`, which is not
tracked by git. The script outputs two files in the root folder,
`email_mentions.json` which should be used by other applications (such
as the report indexer) and `seen_emails_cache.pkl`, which is there to
avoid downloading emails that are already indexes. These files need to
be deleted when the format of the index is updated. Currently this
script needs to be run manually or as a `cron` job.

The report index uses the
[DataTables](https://datatables.net/) JS library. It provides
filtering and sorting capabilities to the indexes tables. The source
file is:
```
serverscripts/WEB/validphys-reports/index.html
```
in the validphys2 directory. It should be updated from time to time to
highlight the most interesting reports at a given moment. This can be
done by for example displaying in a separate table at the beginning
the reports marked with some keyword (for example 'nnpdf31').

The Makefile inside will synchronize them with
the server.

The report indexing script generates thumbnails in the
`WEB/thumbnails` which are then associated to each report. This is
done by looking at the image files inside the `figures` folder of each
uploaded report (see the source of the script for more details). It is
expected that the server redirects the requests for
`vp.nnpdf.science/thumbnails` to this folder.

Editing this guide
==================

The source of this document can be found in the main NNPDF repository as the
file `guide.md`, under

```
doc/validphys2
```

There is a Makefile which will build the HTML document (`pandoc` and `graphviz`
are required), and `make rsync` will upload it to the server, if the user has
sufficient permissions. Of course, changes to the guide should also be commited
to the repository, and if necessary, discussed in a pull request.
