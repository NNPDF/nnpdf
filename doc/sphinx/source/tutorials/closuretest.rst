How to run a closure test
=========================

Closure tests are a way to validate methodology by fitting on pseudodata
generated from pre-existing PDFs. There are different levels of closure tests
which aim to validate different components of the fitting toolchain.

Brief background
----------------

For more detailed information on the conception of closure tests, see the
`NNPDF3.0 paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8849>`_.

Each closure test defines a ``fakepdf`` in the runcard, which will be referred to
here as the underlying law. For the purpose of the closure test it can be thought
of as being a proxy for the true PDF.

There are three levels of closure test:

1. level 0
    - central pseudodata is given by central predictions of the underlying law
    - no MC noise is added on top of the central data, each replica is fitting
      the same set of data
2. level 1
    - central pseudodata is shifted by some noise η which is drawn
      from the experimental covariance matrix and represents
      'real' central values provided by experimentalists which do not sit exactly
      on the underlying law but are consistent with it according to their own
      uncertainty
    - no MC noise is added, each replica fits a subset of the same shifted data.
      There is however a difference in the training/validation split used for
      stopping, the spread on replicas can be thought of as the spread due to this
      split in addition to any methodological uncertainty.
3. level 2
    - central pseudodata is shifted by level 1 noise η
    - MC noise is added on top of the level 1 shift
    - level 2 is a proxy of a real fit, where the underlying law is known

The advantage of knowing the underlying law is that we can see how well the
methodology is extracting this from shifted data, using closure test estimators.

The main obvious disadvantage is that a pre-existing PDF may not be a suitable
proxy for the underlying law.

.. _prep_ct_runcard:
Preparing the closure test runcard
----------------------------------

To run a closure test we require a standard fit runcard. The main section
which controls closure test specific behaviour can be found under ``closuretest``.
Before you've made any changes, a typical ``closuretest`` section will be as follows:

.. code:: yaml

  closuretest:
    filterseed  : 0   # Random seed to be used in filtering data partitions
    fakedata    : False
    fakepdf     : MMHT2014nnlo68cl
    fakenoise   : False

Setting ``fakedata`` to ``True`` will cause closure test pseudodata to be generated
and subsequently fitted. The PDf which the pseudodata will be generated from
is specified by the ``fakepdf`` key. It is strongly advised to set the ``fakepdf``
and ``t0pdfset``, found under ``datacuts`` to be the same PDF, unless specifically
testing the impact of the t0 procedure.

The ``fakenoise`` key specifies whether or not the level 1 shift η will be
add to the pseudodata during the filtering step, this is require for
**both** level 1 and level 2 closure tests.

An example of a typical level 1 or level 2 ``closuretest`` specification is given

.. code:: yaml

  closuretest:
    filterseed  : 0   # Random seed to be used in filtering data partitions
    fakedata    : True
    fakepdf     : MMHT2014nnlo68cl
    fakenoise   : True

Note that it is *critical* that two closure tests which are to be compared have
the same ``filterseed``. They should also both have been run during a time where
no major changes were made to data generation. This is because fits with
different level 1 noise produce different closure test estimators. See for
example a `report <https://vp.nnpdf.science/mbcTUd6-TQmQFvaGd37bkg==/>`_
comparing two level 2 closure tests with identical settings apart from
``filterseed``.

There are still some relevant settings to the closure test. For the above example
we would choose that the t0 set was the same as the underlying law:

.. code:: yaml

  datacuts:
    t0pdfset     : MMHT2014nnlo68cl # PDF set to generate t0 covmat
    ...

Finally we need to specify whether or not MC replicas will be generated in the
fit, differentiating between a level 1 and level 2 closure test. This can be achieved
by setting ``genrep`` to be ``True``

Summary for each level of closure test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See below for the keys which specify each level of closure test, other keys
can be chosen by the user.

Level 0
^^^^^^^

.. code:: yaml

  genrep   : False
  closuretest:
    ...
    fakedata    : True
    fakenoise   : False
    ...

Level 1
^^^^^^^

.. code:: yaml

  genrep   : False
  closuretest:
    ...
    fakedata    : True
    fakenoise   : True
    ...


Level 2
^^^^^^^

.. code:: yaml

  genrep   : True
  closuretest:
    ...
    fakedata    : True
    fakenoise   : True
    ...

Running a closure test with ``n3fit``
-------------------------------------

Running a closure test with ``n3fit`` will require a valid ``n3fit`` runcard, with
the closure test settings modified as shown
:ref:`above <prep_ct_runcard>`. The difference
between running a closure fit in ``n3fit`` and a standard fit is that the user is
required to run ``vp-setupfit`` on the runcard before running ``n3fit``. This is
because the filtering of the data is required to generate the pseudodata central
values. The workflow is as follows:

.. code:: bash

  $ vp-setupfit fitname.yml
  $ n3fit fitname.yml <replica_number>

You will still need to evolve the fit and run ``postfit`` as with a standard
:ref:`n3fit <n3fitindex>`.
