# How to generate a report

Suppose that we want to generate a custom report that includes plots and
statistics that are not included as part of the report generated by
[vp-comparefits](./compare-fits.md). We may be lucky enough to find an example
runcard that produces what we need in `validphys2/examples`. However, we may
need to write our own own `yaml` runcard from scratch.

Suppose we want to have histograms of the χ2 per replica for some set of
experimental datasets.

The calling of `validphys` actions are used as normal. The action we are looking
for is `plot_chi2dist`.

```yaml
meta:
  title: Distribution plots per replica across experiments
  author: Shayan Iranipour
  keywords: [chi2, replica, distribution, DISonly]

fit: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_DISonly

pdf:
  from_: "fit"

experiments:
  from_: "fit"

theoryid: 53

use_cuts: "fromfit"

template_text: |
  # Histograms of χ2
  ## DIS only distributions
  {@experiments::experiment plot_chi2dist@}

actions_:
  - report(main=True)
```

The `report(main=True)` command is what generates the report. We can customize
the formatting of the report using `markdown` syntax. Note for example that `#
Histograms of χ2` gives this section where we will find our plot an appropriate
title.

If the `template_text` section of the runcard becomes large and unwieldy, it may
be preferable to put the information from this section in a separate file. In
such cases one can create a markdown template file, usually called `template.md`
such as

```md
# Histograms of χ2
## DIS only distributions
{@experiments::experiment plot_chi2dist@}
```

and change the `template_text` section of the runcard to the following

```yaml
template: template.md
```

where this assumes that `template.md` is in the same folder as that in which you
execute the `validphys` command.

The `meta` field is important for retrieving the report once it has been
uploaded to the `vp server`. `title` and `author` are fields that appear when
browsing through reports while the `keywords` allow quick retrieval of the
report by the search functionality of the server. Setting appropriate keywords
is especially important when working on a big project, within which it is likely
that many reports will be produced. In such cases a `keyword` should be chosen
for the project and set in each uploaded report.
