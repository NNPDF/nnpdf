# How to generate a report

Suppose that we want to generate a custom report that includes plots and
statistics that are not included as part of the report generated by
[`vp-comparefits`](./compare-fits.md). We may be lucky enough to find an example
runcard that produces what we need in
[`validphys2/examples`](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/tree/master/validphys2/examples).
However, we may need to write our own own [`yaml`](https://yaml.org/) runcard
from scratch.

Suppose we want to have histograms of the χ2 per replica for some set of
experimental datasets.

The calling of [`validphys`](vp-index) actions are used as normal. The action we
are looking for is
[`plot_chi2dist`](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/blob/d79059975e4ef97063c6bdd9f19dfb908586e453/validphys2/src/validphys/dataplots.py#L50).
Here's an example report that does what we're looking for:

```yaml
meta:
  title: Distribution plots per replica across experiments
  author: Shayan Iranipour
  keywords: [chi2, replica, distribution, DISonly]

fit: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_DISonly

pdf:
  from_: "fit"

experiments:
  from_: "fit"

theoryid: 53

use_cuts: "fromfit"

template_text: |
  # Histograms of χ2
  ## DIS only distributions
  {@experiments::experiment plot_chi2dist@}

actions_:
  - report(main=True)
```

The `report(main=True)` command is what generates the report. We can customize
the formatting of the report using
[`markdown`](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
syntax. Note for example that `# Histograms of χ2` gives an appropriate title
to the section where we will find our plot.

If the `template_text` section of the runcard becomes large and unwieldy, it may
be preferable to put the information from this section in a separate file. In
such cases one can create a `markdown` template file, usually called `template.md`
such as

```md
# Histograms of χ2
## DIS only distributions
{@experiments::experiment plot_chi2dist@}
```

and change the `template_text` section of the runcard to the following

```yaml
template: template.md
```

where this assumes that `template.md` is in the same folder as that in which you
execute the `validphys` command.

The `meta` field is important for retrieving the report once it has been
uploaded to the [validphys server](https://vp.nnpdf.science/). `title` and
`author` are fields that appear when browsing through reports while the
`keywords` allow quick retrieval of the report by the search functionality of
the server. Setting appropriate keywords is especially important when working on
a big project, within which it is likely that many reports will be produced. In
such cases a `keyword` should be chosen for the project and set in each uploaded
report.
