Handling experimental data: Buildmaster
---------------------------------------

Buildmaster is the code that allows the user to generate the ``DATA``
and ``SYSTYPE`` files that contain, respectively, the experimental data
and the information pertaining to the treatment of systematic errors. It
is available as a folder within the nnpdf project

::

   https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/buildmaster

The structure of the files generated by the buildmaster project is
documented in `Experimental data files <exp_data_files>`__.

Once the remainder of the nnpdf project is compiled and installed, the
buildmaster code can be compiled and installed as follows

::

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j && make install

This will generate the ``buildmaster`` executable which shall be run as

::

   ./buildmaster

The ``DATA_`` and ``SYSTYPE_`` files will be generated, respectively, in

::

   results/
   results/systypes/

They should then be copied into

::

   nnpdf/nnpdfcpp/data/commondata
   nnpdf/nnpdfcpp/data/commondata/systypes/

Whenever a new data set is implemented, the buildmaster code should be
updated accordingly. Detailed instructions on how to do so are provided
in the tutorial :ref:`Implementing a new experiment in
buildmaster <buildmastertuto>`.
