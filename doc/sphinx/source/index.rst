NNPDF documentation
===================
* The `NNPDF collaboration <https://nnpdf.mi.infn.it/>`_ is an organisation performing 
  research in high-energy physics to determine the structure of the proton by producing
  **parton distribution functions (PDFs)**.

* This documentation is for the `NNPDF code <https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf>`_, which 
  allows the user to perform PDF fits and analyse the output.
