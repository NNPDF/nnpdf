Specifying data cuts
--------------------

The experimental ``CommonData`` files contain more data points than we
actually fit. Some data points are excluded for reasons such as the
instability of the perturbative expansion in their corresponding
kinematic regions.

There are four possibilities for handling the experimental cuts within
validphys, which are controlled with the ``use_cuts`` configuration
setting:

``use_cuts: 'nocuts'`` \* This causes the content of the data files to
be taken unmodified. Note that some theory predictions may be ill
defined in this situation.

``use_cuts: 'fromfit'`` \* The cuts are read from the masks given as
input to ```n3fit`` <../n3fit/index.html>`__, and generated by
```vp-setupfit`` <scripts.html>`__. An existing fit is required, to load
the cuts, and must contain the masks for all the datasets analyzed in
the active namespace.

``use_cuts: 'internal'`` \* Compute the cut masks as ``vp-setupfit``
would do. Currently the parameters ``q2min`` and ``w2min`` must be
given. These can in turn be set to the same as the fit values by loading
the ``datacuts`` namespace from the fit. In this case, the cuts will
normally coincide with the ones loaded with the ``fromfit`` setting.

``use_cuts: 'fromintersection'`` \* Compute the internal cuts as per
``use_cuts: 'internal'`` within each namespace in a `namespace
list <#multiple-inputs-and-namespaces>`__ called
``cuts_intersection_spec`` and take the intersection of the results as
the cuts for the given dataset. This is useful for example for requiring
the common subset of points that pass the cuts at NLO and NNLO.

``use_cuts: 'fromsimilarpredictions'`` \* Compute the intersection
between two namespaces (similar to for ``fromintersection``) but
additionally require that the predictions computed for each dataset
across the namespaces are *similar*, specifically that the ratio between
the absolute difference in the predictions and the total experimental
uncertainty is smaller than a given value, ``cut_similarity_threshold``
that must be provided. Note that for this to work with different
C-factors across the namespaces, one must provide a different
``dataset_inputs`` list for each. \* This mechanism can be ignored
selectively for specific datasets. To do that, add their names to a list
called ``do_not_require_similarity_for``. The datasets in the list do
not need to appear in the ``cuts_intersection_spec`` namespace and will
be filtered according to the internal cuts unconditionally.

The following example demonstrates the first three options:

Here we put together the results with the different filtering policies
in a `data-theory comparison <data-theory-comp>`__ plot and then plot
the χ² distribution for each one individually. With these settings the
latter three
`dataspecs <#general-data-specification-the-dataspec-api>`__ give the
same result.

The following example demonstrates the use of
``fromsimilarpredictions``:
