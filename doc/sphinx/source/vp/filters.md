Filtering data
==============

# Introduction

In PDF fits, not all the data provided by the experimental collaborations
are useful. For example, we may wish to discard certain datapoints for
which we know small-x resummation or electroweak corrections are important.
These effects are problematic since we know them to be important, but we cannot
account for them.

In this light, we produce cuts of the data, by filtering data
points which we know are free of the above and other problems.

In `validphys 2`, the cuts are handled by the `validphys.filters` alongside filter
definitions and defaults found within `validphys.cuts`.
.

# Cuts as declarative filters

Due to the nature of data cuts, it is important to be transparent about which cuts
are being applied to which dataset and/or process. Moreover, it is useful for the
rules defining the data cut to be readable such that a non-developmental user can
read and understand the nature of the rule by making these rules functions of
kinematic variables such as `p_T` or `Q2`.

In much the same vein, it is useful for any default values used in the rules to
be readily accessible. For example, suppose there is a minimum value for the square
transferred momenta in the DIS process `q2min`, that is used widely by many different
rules. It is important for this variable to be in an obvious and easily accessed
location.

## Defaults

There are certain values which are commonly used by many rules. For example,
the value `q2min` usually takes the value `3.49` or `w2min` is usually set to `12.5`.

It is thus useful to define these default values somewhere. These values can be found
within `validphys.cuts` inside the `defaults.yaml` file. One can overwrite these values
and this is discussed later.

## Filters


In `validphys 2` the default filter rules used can be found in the `validphys.cuts`
module within the `filter.yaml` file. This file is read by `validphys` and is interpreted
as a `list` of `dictionaries`.

By default, these filters can have several entries:

1. `dataset`: The dataset this rule applies
2. `process_type`: The process type this rule applies to
3. `rule`: The `Python` code defining the rule for this filter
4. `reason`: (optional) The reason this rule was needed
5. `local_variables`: (optional) Any additional, non-standard local variables the user
wishes to add for this rule only.

```eval_rst
.. note::
  At least one of :code:`dataset` or :code:`process_type` is required.
  Additionally, a :code:`rule` entry is always required.
```

The `rule` entry in the rule definition is `eval`uated as `Python` code. If the rule
does not apply to this particular datapoint (say the dataset names don't match) then
we return `None` indicating this rule had nothing to do with this particular datapoint.
In this case, we move on to the next rule. However, if the process type or dataset defined
in the rule match that of the datapoint, we evaluate the rule. If the rule evaluates to
`False` we discard the point, if instead it returns `True` we move on to the next rule. 
If by the time all the rules have been evaluated and we have yet to return `False`, then
the datapoint passes and it is kept.

In addition, the user can add any theory parameter they wish. For example, one could
add `PTO: NNLO` which means to evaluate the rule only if the theory is NNLO. These are
discussed further [here](#PTO). One can see a full list of possible theory parameters using:
`vp-checktheory <theory id>`


```eval_rst

.. important::
    The :code:`rule` entry should be interpreted as a :code:`str` type within :code:`Python`. As such
    a rule such as :code:`rule: True` is not valid since this is read in as a boolean,
    however, :code:`rule: "True"` is perfectly valid notation. Moreover, the string
    itself should be valid :code:`Python` code.
```

By default the user can use the following non-builtin mathematical functions in
their rules: `sqrt`, `log` or `fabs` (floating point absolute value). In addition,
one can use any `numpy` function using `np.<function>` in their rule definition.
For example:
```yaml
rule: "np.exp(x) > 0.1"
```

The kinematic variables that can be used within the rule depends on the process type.
A full list of available parameters can be found by running:
```ipython
In [1]: from NNPDF import CommonData                                               

In [2]: print(dict(CommonData.kinLabel))
```

The user may additionally define their own variables by adding the `local_variables`
field to their rule. For example, I can use `w2` in my rule, so long as I define what
I mean by `w2`:
```yaml
  local_variables:
    w2: Q2 * (1 - x) / x
```

```eval_rst
.. danger::
  Defining :code:`local_variables` is non-commutative. The order of definition is important.
  If a local variable depends on other local variables, then the user must ensure all other
  dependencies have already been defined.
```
The following would raise an error
```yaml
  local_variables:
    w: sqrt(w2)
    w2: Q2 * (1 - x) / x
```
The following would not
```yaml
  local_variables:
    w2: Q2 * (1 - x) / x
    w: sqrt(w2)
```
```eval_rst
.. note::
  :code:`local_variables` have a local scope. They apply to only the rule within which
  they are defined.
```

### Theory parameters and perturbative orders 
<a name="PTO"></a>
There are particular situations in which we only want to evaluate a rule if the theory
input for the PDF matches certain conditions. For example, it may be the case we only
keep the datapoint provided the theory includes intrinsic charm or is evaluated at NNLO.

Suppose for example I wish the rule to only be evaluated if the theory includes intrinsic
charm. We note in the `theory.get_description()`, the relevant entry is `'IC': 1` (we use
here theory 53 for demonstration purposes). Thus if I want my rule to be applied only if
the theory has intrinsic charm, I simply add to my rule:
```yaml
  IC: True
```
Similarly I can condition on flavour number scheme. I again check `theory.get_description()`
and note that the relevant `key` is `'FNS'`. Thus to only evaluate my rule if the FNS is
`FONLL-C`, simply add:
```yaml
  FNS: FONLL-C
```
Similarly, one can add any such theory description `key` into their rule.

```eval_rst
.. tip::
  Sometimes, we may want to evaluate a rule provided the perturbative order is within
  a certain range. For example, we may want a rule to be evaluated if the perturbative
  order is strictly less than NLO. This can be done by using directives succeeding the
  :code:`PTO` declaration.
```
In the above example, one would thus simply use:
```yaml
  PTO: NLO-
```
The following are a list of possible directives which can succeed a `PTO` declaration:
* `+` Evaluate this rule if the theory `PTO` is greater than **or equal to** the preceeding PTO
* `-` Evaluate this rule if the theory `PTO` is strictly less than the preceeding PTO
* `!` Evaluate this rule if the theory `PTO` is not equal to the preceeding PTO

Examples are:
```yaml
  PTO: NNLO!
  PTO: N3LO-
  PTO: LO+
```

If the user doesn't specify a directive then that implies the rule will only be evaluated if
the declared `PTO` matches *exactly* with the `PTO` of the theory.

## Overwriting filters and default values

One can overwrite the default behaviour by adding to the fit runcard.

Custom rules can be added by adding a `filter_rules:` namespace in the fit runcard. This should
be a list of rules in the format outlined above. For example:
```yaml
filter_rules:
  - dataset: NMC
    rule: x > 0.2
```

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  Adding a :code:`filter_rules` section to the runcard overwrites the default behaviour and does
  **not** append to the default behaviour. This is done intentionally since a rule cannot be 
  overwritten by another rule. By adding the above code snippet, this would be the **only** rule used by
  :code:`vp-setupfit`. As such a bit of copy and pasting may be necessary if one wishes to append a rule.
```

Similarly the defaults can be overwritten by adding a `filter_defaults` namespace to the runcard. For example:
```yaml
filter_defaults:
  q2min: 5
  w2min: 10
```
As in the case of the rules, this overwrites the original defaults and does not append to them.

```eval_rst
.. attention::
  To ensure backwards compatibility with old style runcards, if :code:`q2min` and :code:`w2min` are defined
  under the :code:`datacuts` namespace within the runcard, these values are read in and override the default
  values. However, if this overriding occurs, a warning is displayed in standard output.
```



## Examples

Consider the following filter from the `filters.yaml` file:
```yaml
- dataset: ATLASZPT7TEV
  reason: Avoid the region where resummation effects become important.
  rule: "p_T2 >= 30**2"
```
this rule applies only to the `ATLASZPT7TEV` dataset and keeps all datapoints with a
transverse momentum greater than or equal to 30 MeV. The reason for the conception
of this rule is also provided and we see that it is due to the fact that datapoints
with smaller transverse momentum will be affected by resummation effects.

Now consider the slightly more complicated example:
```yaml
- dataset: CMSDY2D12
  reason: Remove data points for which electroweak corrections are large.
  PTO: NNLO-
  local_variables:
    M: sqrt(M2)
    min_M: 30.0
    max_rapidity: 2.2
  rule: M >= min_M and etay <= max_rapidity
```
This rule only applies to `CMSDY2D12`. I wish for the `rule` to only be evaluated
provided the `theory` perturbative order is **strictly** less than NNLO (i.e LO or NLO).
I check what the process type of `CMSDY2D12` is:
```ipython
In [1]: from validphys.loader import Loader                                                                                                                                   

In [2]: l = Loader()                                                                                                                                                          

In [3]: cd = l.check_commondata("CMSDY2D12")                                                                                                                                  

In [4]: cd.process_type                                                                                                                                                       
Out[4]: 'EWK_RAP'
```
Then cross check this against `NNPDF.CommonData.kinLabels` to see that the relevant
kinematic variables are:
```
'EWK_RAP': ('etay', 'M2', 'sqrts'),
```
I choose to define custom `local_variables` in the form of `M` which is the square
root of the invariant mass squared, i.e. just the invariant mass. Moreover, I define a
value for minimum `M` and maximum rapidity which I use in my `rule` as cutoff values.

The `rule` itself is then self-explanatory, notice however, it is written in valid
`Python` syntax. Finally, the reason for the rule is given which is to cut datapoints
which are affected by electroweak corrections.

As a final example consider the following rule:
```yaml
- process_type: DIS_NCP_CH
  reason: |
    Missing higher order corrections to Delta F_IC, the piece that needs
    to be added to the FONLL-C calculation in the case of fitted charm.
  FNS: FONLL-C
  IC: True
  rule: "Q2 > 8"
```
Instead of this rule applying to one particular dataset, we see it is applicable to all
datasets that have process type `DIS_NCP_CH`. The reason for the rule is rather involved
and so `yaml`'s multiline string syntax is used.

Finally, the user wishes for the `rule` to be evaluated **only if** the theory input has
the FONNL-C flavour number scheme and if the theory uses intrinsic charm. The rule itself
is trivial.
