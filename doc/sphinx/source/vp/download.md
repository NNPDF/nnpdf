Downloading resources
=====================

`validphys` is designed so that, by default, resources stored in known remote
locations are downloaded automatically and seamlessly used where necessary.
Available resources include PDF sets, completed fits, theories, and results of
past `validphys` runs [uploaded to the server](upload). The `vp-get` tool,
[described below](#the-vp-get-tool), can be used to download the same items
manually.

Automatic operation
-------------------

By default when some resource such as a PDF is required by `validphys` (or
derived tools such as `vp-setupfit`), the code will first look for it in some
local directory specified in the [profile file](nnprofile). If it is not found
there, it will try to download it from some remote repository (also specified in
the profile).

For example a `validphys` runcard such as

```yaml
pdf: NNPDF30_nnlo_as_0118
fit: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_uncorr_s3

theoryid: 53

use_cuts: "fromfit"

dataset_input:
    dataset: ATLASWZRAP36PB
    cfac: [EWK]

actions_:
  - plot_fancy
  - plot_chi2dist
```

Will download if necessary the fit called `NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_uncorr_s3`, the
PDF set called `NNPDF30_nnlo_as_0118` and the theory with ID 52, when validphys
is executed with the default settings. In practice one rarely has to worry about
installing resources by hand when working with NNPDF tools.

The behaviour of downloading automatically can be disabled by passing the
`--no-net` flag to supported tools. In that case, failure to find a given
resource locally will result in an error and exiting the program. The ``--net``
flag makes the default behaviour explicit and has no effect otherwise.


What can be downloaded
----------------------

The following resources are found automatically:

```eval_rst
Fits
    Fits (specified by the ``fit`` key) can be downloaded if they have previously
    been uploaded with :ref:`vp-upload <upload>`. The corresponding PDF
    set will be installed as appropriate.

PDF sets
    PDF sets (specified among others by the ``pdf`` key) are searched for in
    both NNPDF and LHAPDF repositories. If the PDF is not found and a fit with
    the same name exists, it will be downloaded and the corresponding PDF set
    will be installed and made available for usage.

Theories
    Theories (specified by the ``theoryid`` key) are downloaded and
    uncompressed.

``validphys`` output files
    Files produced by ``validphys`` can be used as input to subsequent validphys
    analyses (for example χ² tables are used for αs fits). The user needs to
    have HTTP access to the repository, which is provided when installing using
    the :ref:`bootstrap script <conda>`. Output files are not specified by any
    top level config key, but instead actions can specify their own logic, for
    example for using an existing file instead of computing it.
```

```eval_rst
.. _vp-get:
```

The `vp-get` tool
-----------------

The ``vp-get`` tool can be used to download resources manually, in the same way
``validphys`` would do.

The basic syntax is
```bash
vp-get <resource_type> <resource_name>
```
The available options for `<resource type>` can be seen with `vp-get --list`.
They correspond to the resources described [above](#what-can-be-downloaded).

```bash
$ vp-get --list
Available resource types:
 - fit
 - pdf
 - theoryID
 - vp_output_file
```
For example to download the fit ``NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000`` we would write

```bash
$ vp-get fit NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000
```

If the resource is already installed locally, the tool will display some
information on it and bail out:

```bash
$ vp-get fit NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000
FitSpec(name='NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000', path=PosixPath('/home/zah/anaconda3/envs/nnpdf-dev/share/NNPDF/results/NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000'))
```

Downloading resources in code (``validphys.loader``)
----------------------------------------------------

```eval_rst
The automatic download logic is implemented in the :py:mod:`validphys.loader`,
specifically by the :py:class:`validphys.loader.RemoteLoader` and
:py:class:`validphys.loader.FallbackLoader` classes.

The logic is as follows: Given a resource type ``<foo>``, the normal
:py:class:`validphys.loader.Loader` class would implement a ``check_<foo>`` method
returning an object containing the appropriate metadata (such as file paths), or
raise a ``LoaderError`` if the object cannot be found. The ``check_<foo>`` method
of ``FallbackLoader`` (which is generated dynamically) will intercept the
``LoaderError`` and, if it happens, call the ``download_<foo>`` method of
``RemoteLoader``, if it exists. That method should cause the resource to be
installed in such a way that the subsequent call of the ``Loader.check_<foo>``
method succeeds. That is it should downoad the resource to the relevant search
path, and uncompress it if needed.
```
In practice one can get a download aware loader by using a ``FallbackLoader``
instance, which will try to obtain all the required resources from remote
locations.

```python
from validphys.loader import FallbackLoader as Loader

l = Loader()
#Will download theory 151 if needed.
l.check_dataset('NMC', theoryid=151)
```

Conversely the ``Loader`` class will only search locally.
```python

from validphys.loader import Loader

l = Loader()

l.check_dataset('NMC', theoryid=151)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TheoryNotFound                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    416 
    417         if not isinstance(theoryid, TheoryIDSpec):
--> 418             theoryid = self.check_theoryID(theoryid)
    419 
    420         theoryno, _ = theoryid

~/nngit/nnpdf/validphys2/src/validphys/loader.py in check_theoryID(self, theoryID)
    288         if not theopath.exists():
    289             raise TheoryNotFound(("Could not find theory %s. "
--> 290                   "Folder '%s' not found") % (theoryID, theopath) )
    291         return TheoryIDSpec(theoryID, theopath)
    292 

TheoryNotFound: Could not find theory 151. Folder '/home/zah/anaconda3/share/NNPDF/data/theory_151' not found
```

Output files uploaded to the `validphys` can be retrieved specifying their path
(starting from the report ID). They will be either downloaded (when using
`FallbackLoader`) or retrieved from the cache:
```python
from validphys.loader import FallbackLoader as Loader
l = Loader()
l.check_vp_output_file('qTpvLZLwS924oAsmpMzhFw==/figures/f_ns0_fitunderlyinglaw_plot_closure_pdf_histograms_0.pdf')
PosixPath('/home/zah/anaconda3/share/NNPDF/vp-cache/qTpvLZLwS924oAsmpMzhFw==/figures/f_ns0_fitunderlyinglaw_plot_closure_pdf_histograms_0.pdf')
```
