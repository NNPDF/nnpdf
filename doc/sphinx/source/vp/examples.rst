Example validphys runcards can be found
`here <https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/tree/master/validphys2/examples>`_. These are useful when
trying to gain familiarity with how to produce results with validphys or when you want to carry
out a common task, e.g. plotting some PDFs, and you do not want to write the runcard yourself.

It is strongly encouraged to capitalise namespaces, e.g. ``PDFscalespecs`` rather than ``pdfscalespecs``.
This is to avoid confusion between namespaces, which are relevant only to that runcard, and any actions
within ``validphys``, which by convention are lower case.

Here we detail the examples that already exist and list the resources which it is recommended that
you use when writing a new example runcard.

Recommended resources
=====================

The resources that should be used in example runcards, where possible, match the defaults used in
the `tests <https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/blob/master/validphys2/src/validphys/tests/conftest.py#L23>`_.
It is recommended that these are used to avoid situations when the user has to download different
resources, which can be costly in terms of time and memory, to run each example runcard.

The recommended resources are:
