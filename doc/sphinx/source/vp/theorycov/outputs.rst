Below is the template corresponding to the runcard in the previous
section. This will produce a report with the important features of the
theory covariance module. These fall into three broad categories:

#. **Matrices and plots of matrices**. Heatmap plots, diagonal element
   plots comparing experimental and theoretical errors.

#. :math:`\chi^2` **values**. Total :math:`\chi^2`\ s and per dataset
   and per experiment. Bar chart comparing before and after adding
   theory errors for the per dataset case.

#. **Scale variations as a function of kinematics.** Plots of the
   theoretical predictions for each data point for the different scale
   choices.
