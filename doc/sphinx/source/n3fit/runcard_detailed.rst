- :ref:`otheroptions-label`

.. _datasetsel-label:

Dataset selection
-----------------
The first thing one finds when building a fit runcard for
``nnpdf`` is the dataset selection, `dataset_inputs`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    dataset_inputs:
        - { dataset: SLACP_dwsh, frac: 0.5}
        - { dataset: NMCPD_dw, frac: 0.5 }
        - { dataset: ATLASZPT8TEVMDIST, frac: 0.75, sys: 10, cfac: [QCD] }


The `dataset_inputs` key contains a list of dictionaries defining the datasets
to be used in the fit as well as their options (which are detailed in :ref:`datasetspec-core-label`).

Training / Validation split
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The fraction of events that are considered for the training and validation sets is defined by the ``frac`` key in the ``experiment:dataset`` parameter of the nnpdf runcard. A fraction of ``X`` means that ``X`` of the event will go into the training set while ``1-X`` will enter the validation set for that dataset.

.. code-block:: yaml

    dataset_inputs:
    - { dataset: SLACP_dwsh, frac: 0.75}

It is possible to run a fit with no validation set by setting the fraction to ``1.0``, in this case the training set will be used as validation set.

The random seed for the training/validation split is defined by the variable ``trvlseed``.
By default the seed is further modified by the replica index, but it is possible
to fix it such that it is the same for all replicas with ``same_trvl_per_replica``
(``false`` by default).

.. code-block:: yaml

    trvlseed: 7
    same_trvl_per_replica: true


.. _preprocessing-label:

Preprocessing
-------------
The behaviour of the preprocessing in the ``n3fit`` code is controlled, as in the old ``nnfit`` code, through the ``fitting:basis`` parameter of the nnpdf runcard.

The preprocessing factor applied to every flavour of the basis is:

.. math::

    x ^ {1 - \alpha} (1 - x) ^{\beta}


This parameter accepts a list of the size of the chosen basis with a number of parameter for each flavour. The parameters  used in ``n3fit`` are:

- ``fl``: name of the flavour, this name will be use to define the name of the weights as ``alpha_{fl}`` and ``beta_{fl}``.
- ``smallx``: range of the ``alpha``
- ``largex``: range of the ``beta``
- ``trainable``: sets the flavour basis to be trainable or not, defaults to ``True``

Setting the ``trainable`` flag to ``False`` is equivalent to recovering the old behaviour of ``nnfit``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    fitting:
        basis:
            # smallx, largex: preprocessing ranges
            - { fl: sng, smallx: [1.05,1.19], largex: [1.47,2.70], trainable: False }
            - { fl: g,   smallx: [0.94,1.25], largex: [0.11,5.87], trainable: False }
            - { fl: v,   smallx: [0.54,0.75], largex: [1.15,2.76], trainable: False }
            - { fl: v3,  smallx: [0.21,0.57], largex: [1.35,3.08] }
            - { fl: v8,  smallx: [0.52,0.76], largex: [0.77,3.56], trainable: True }
            - { fl: t3,  smallx: [-0.37,1.52], largex: [1.74,3.39] }
            - { fl: t8,  smallx: [0.56,1.29], largex: [1.45,3.03] }
            - { fl: cp,  smallx: [0.12,1.19], largex: [1.83,6.70] }

It  is important to determine the correct values for the ``largex`` and ``smallx`` preprocessing
ranges. For example setting a poor range for those parameters can result in a conflict with the
:ref:`positivity <positivity>` or :ref:`integrability <integrability>` constraints, making it such
that no replicas can satisfy those constraints. In most cases when changes are made to a runcard,
they will have a relatively small effect on the required preprocessing ranges. This includes common
variations to runcards such as changing the datasets, or settings related to the training of the
neural network. In these cases :ref:`running an iterated fit <run-iterated-fit>` is likely the
easiest way to obtain a satisfactory range of the preprocessing. However, in some cases, such as for
example a change of PDF basis where the preprocessing ranges obtain a different meaning entirely,
we don't know what a good starting point for the ranges would be. One way to identify good ranges
is by opening up the ``smallx`` and ``large`` parameters for large ranges and setting
``trainable: True``. This way the preprocessing exponents will be considered part of the free
parameters of the model, and as such they will be fitted by the optimization algorithm.

NNPDF4.0 fits are run with ``trainable: False``, because trainable preprocessing exponents can lead
to an underestimation of the PDF uncertainties in the extrapolation domain. So after determining a
reasonable range for the preprocessing exponents, a new runcard should be generated using
``vp-nextfitruncard`` as explained in :ref:_run-iterated-fit. In this runcard one should then
manually set ``trainable: False`` for all preprocessing exponents before running the iterated fit.
It can take more than one iteration before the iterated fits have converged to stable values for the
preprocessing ranges.

Note that the script ``vp-nextfitruncard`` automatically enforces some constraints
on preprocessing ranges, which are required for integrability of certain
flavours. Specifically clipping the maximum value of the small-x exponent
as :math:`\alpha \leq 1` for the valence PDFs and triplets T3 and T8.
More details on those limits, and how to disable them can be found
by running

.. code::

    $ vp-nextfitruncard --help

More information on ``vp-nextfitruncard`` can be found in
:ref:`run-iterated-fit`.

.. _networkarch-label:

Network Architecture
--------------------
There are different network architectures implemented in ``n3fit``.
Which can be selected by changing the ``parameters::layer_type`` parameter in the runcard.
All layer types implement the ``nodes_per_layer``, ``activation_per_layer`` and ``initializer`` parameters.

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameters:
        nodes_per_layer: [5, 3, 8]
        activation_per_layer: ['tanh', 'tanh', 'linear']
        layer_type: 'dense_per_flavour'
        initializer: 'glorot_normal'

- **One single network** (``layer_type: dense``):

  Extra accepted parameters:
    - `dropout`: float
        see `keras dropout <https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout>`_
    - `regularizer`: str
        see `keras regularizers <https://keras.io/regularizers/>`_
    - `regularizer_args`: dict
        choice arguments for the `regularizer`

In this mode all nodes are connected with all nodes of the next layer. In this case there is one single network which take as input the value of ``x`` (and ``log(x)``) and outputs all different flavours.

In this case the ``nodes_per_layer`` parameter represents the nodes each one of these layers has. For instance ``[40, 20, 8]`` corresponds to a network where the first layer is a matrix ``(2x40)`` (the input is ``x, log(x)``), the second layer is a matrix ``(40x20)`` and the third and final one ``(20x8)``.

- **One network per flavour** (``layer_type: dense_per_flavour``):

This mode is designed to behave as the methodology for NNPDF before 3.1 where each flavour has a separated identical network.

In this case the ``nodes_per_layer`` parameter represents the nodes each layer of each flavour has. For instance ``[5, 3, 8]`` means that the first step is a list of 8 layers of shape ``(2x5)``, while the second layer is again a list that matches the previous one (i.e., 8 layers) with layers of shape ``(5x3)`` while the last layer has two task. The output of each layer should be one single element (i.e., 8 ``(3x1)`` layers) and then concatenate them all so that the final output of the neural network will be a 8-elements tensor. A report comparing the ``dense`` and ``dense_per_flavour`` architectures can be found  `here <https://vp.nnpdf.science/q6Rm1Q_rTguJwKsLOZFoig==/>`_


.. _optimizer-label:

Optimizer
---------

One of the most important parameters defining the training of the Neural Network is the choice
of optimizer (and its corresponding options).

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameters:
        optimizer:
          optimizer_name: 'Adadelta'
          learning_rate: 1.0
          clipnorm: 1.0


The full list of optimizers accepted by the ``n3fit`` and their arguments
can be checked in the `MetaModel <https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/blob/master/n3fit/src/n3fit/backends/keras_backend/MetaModel.py>`_ file.



.. _positivity-label:

Positivity
----------

In ``n3fit`` the behavior of the positivity observables has changed with respect to ``nnfit``.
In ``nnfit`` the loss due to the positivity observable was multiplied by a ``maxlambda`` for each observable, defined in the runcard as:

.. code-block:: yaml

    positivity:
      posdatasets:
        - {dataset: POSF2U, maxlambda: 1e6}


This behavior was found to be very inefficient for gradient descent based strategies and was exchanged for a dynamical Lagrange multiplier.
The dynamical multiplier is defined in terms of a initial value and a multiplier to be applied each 100 epochs.
Both the initial value and the 100 epochs multiplier are defined as an optional ``positivity`` dictionary alongside the hyperparameters of
the Neural Network as:

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameters:
      positivity:
        threshold: 1e-6
        multiplier: 1.05
        initial: 14.5

Note that by defining the positivity in this way all datasets will share the same Lagrange multiplier.

It is also possible to not define the positivity hyperparameters (or define them only partially).
In this case ``n3fit`` will set the initial Lagrange multiplier as ``initial`` (default: 1.0)
while the ``multiplier`` will be such that after the last epoch the final Lagrange multiplier
equals the ``maxlambda`` defined for the dataset.

Finally we have the positivity threshold, which is set to ``1e-6`` by default.
During the fit, the positivity loss will be compared to this value. If it is above it,
the positivity won't be considered good (and thus the fit won't stop).
If the replica reaches the maximum number of epochs with the positivity loss above
this value, it will be tagged as ``POS_VETO`` and the replica removed from postfit.


.. _integrability-label:

Integrability
-------------
Integrability in ``n3fit`` is enforced through a Lagrange multiplier, this is
the same basic concept as how positivity is enforced, and therefore the
input in the runcard is analogous to the case of positivity where one can
apply the integrability contraints through an optional ``integrability``
dictionary as (not that as opposed to positivity, for integrability no
threshold value can be set):

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameters:
      integrability:
        multiplier: 1.05
        initial: 14.5


Again similar to positivity, it is also possible to leave either the ``initial``
or ``multiplier`` keys empty and instead define a ``maxlambda`` per dataset:

.. code-block:: yaml

    integrability:
      integdatasets:
        - {dataset: INTEGXT8, maxlambda: 1e2}



Regularized covariance matrices
-------------------------------

The :ref:`covariance matrix regularization <covmat-reg>` is controlled by a
`norm_threshold` parameter. By default if the parameter is not set, no
regularization is applied. It is found that the effect of aggressive
correlation models can be tested by setting values of 4 (which roughly
corresponds to the assumptions that correlations are controlled to an accuracy
of better than 35%) or higher.


.. code-block:: yaml

    norm_threshold: 4


.. _tensorboard-label:

Inspecting and profiling the code
---------------------------------

It is possible to inspect the ``n3fit`` code using `TensorBoard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/>`_.
In order to enable the TensorBoard callback in ``n3fit`` it is enough with adding the following options in the runcard:


.. code-block:: yaml

    tensorboard:
        weight_freq: 100
        profiling: True


The ``weight_freq`` flag controls each how many epochs the weights of the NN are stored.
Note that smaller values will lead to slower performance and increased memory usage.


After the ``n3fit`` run has finished, details of the run can be found in the replica directory, under the ``tboard`` subfolder.
Logging details can be visualized in the browser with the following command:


.. code-block:: bash

    tensorboard --logdir runcard_name/nnfit/replica_1/tboard

Logging details will include the value of the loss for each experiment over time,
the values of the weights of the NN,
as well as a detailed analysis of the amount of time that TensorFlow spent on each operation.


.. _parallel-label:

Running fits in parallel
------------------------

It is possible to run fits in parallel with ``n3fit`` by setting the ``parallel_models``
flag in the runcard to ``true`` when running a range of replicas.
Running in parallel can be quite hard on memory and it is only advantageous when
fitting on a GPU, where one can find a speed up equal to the number of models run
in parallel (each model being a different replica).

When running in parallel it might be advantageous (e.g., for debugging)
to set the training validation split to be equal for all replicas,
this can be done with the `same_trvl_per_replica: true` runcard flag.

In other words, in order to run several replicas in parallel in a machine
(be it a big CPU or, most likely, a GPU)
it is necessary to modify the ``n3fit`` runcard by adding the following
top-level option:

.. code-block:: yaml

  parallel_models: true


And then run ``n3fit`` with a replica range to be parallelized
(in this case from replica 1 to replica 4).

.. code-block:: bash

   n3fit runcard.yml 1 -r 4


In machines with more than one GPU you can select the GPU in which the code
should run by setting the environment variable ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``
to the right index (usually ``0, 1, 2``) or leaving it explicitly empty
to avoid running on GPU: ``export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""``


.. _otheroptions-label:

Other options
-------------

Threshold :math:`\chi2`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameters:
        threshold_chi2: 4.0

- ``threshold_chi2``: sets a maximum validation :math:`\chi2` for the stopping to activate. Avoids (too) early stopping.


Save and load weights of the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

    save: "weights.h5"
    load: "weights.h5"

- ``save``: saves the weights of the PDF model in the selected file in the replica folder.
- ``load``: loads the weights of the PDF model from the selected file.

Since the weights depend only on the architecture of the Neural Network,
it is possible to save the weights of a Neural Network trained with one set of hyperparameters and experiments
and load it in a different runcard and continue the training from there.

While the load file is read as an absolute path, the file to save to will be found
inside the replica folder.

Saving and loading fit pseudodata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user wishes to save the Monte Carlo pseudodata used for each replica within a fit,
they can do so using the ``savepseudodata`` flag under the ``fitting`` top-level namespace:

.. code-block:: yaml

   fitting:
      savepseudodata: true

This will cause a ``csv`` file to be saved for each replica under
``<fit_directory>/replica_<number>/datacuts_theory_fitting_training_pseudodata.csv`` and
``<fit_directory>/replica_<number>/datacuts_theory_fitting_validation_pseudodata.csv``
for the training and validation splits respectively. The data points are indexed
according to their experiment. Additionally, the union of these two is saved in
``<fit_directory>/replica_<number>/datacuts_theory_fitting_pseudodata_table.csv``
if one is not interested in the exact nature of the splitting.


Imposing sum rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default in ``n3fit`` sum rules are imposed following the definitions in Eq. (10) of
the `NNPDF3.0 paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8849.pdf#page=29>`_.
It is however possible to disable them by setting to false the ``sum_rules`` flag.

.. code-block:: yaml

    fitting:
      sum_rules: False


It is also possible to impose just the valence or the momentum sum rules by using the
``VSR`` or ``MSR`` flags, respectively (``True`` is equal to ``All``).
