Fitting code: ``n3fit``
===================

-  ``n3fit`` is the next generation fitting code for NNPDF developed by the 
   N3PDF team - see `(hep-ph/1907.05075) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05075>`_ 
-  ``n3fit`` is responsible for fitting PDFs from NNPDF4.0 onwards. 
-  The code is implemented in python using `Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_
   and `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_.
-  The sections below are an overview of the ``n3fit`` design.
