Organisation of data files
==========================

The ``nnpdf`` code needs to be able to handle a great deal of different
options with regard to the treatment of both experimental data and theoretical
choices. In the code, every effort has been made to keep experimental and
theoretical parameters strictly separate.
In this section we shall specify the layout of the ``nnpdf`` data
directory. It is in this directory that all of the read-only data to be used in
the fit are accessed. The data files is located in the ``nnpdf`` git
repository, under the ``nnpdf_data`` package.

Experimental data storage
=========================

The central repository for ``CommonData`` in use by ``nnpdf`` projects is
located in the ``nnpdf`` git repository at

	``nnpdf_data/nnpdf_data/commondata``

where a separate ``CommonData`` file is stored for each *Dataset* with the
filename format described in :ref:`dataset-naming-convention`.
The data is installed as part of the python package of ``nnpdf``,
all data files to be installed must have a ``.yaml`` extension.


Theory lookup table
===================

In order to organise the various different theoretical treatments available,
the theory definitions are saved in theory cards located in

	``nnpdf_data/nnpdf_data/theory_cards``

in the form of ``yaml`` files. A new theory can be added by simply adding a new
``yaml`` file with the desired theory ID. The definition of the accepted and required parameters
can be found at:

	``nnpdf_data/nnpdf_data/theorydbutils.py``

The following lines will check whether a newly added theory can be read by validphys
(change 700 by the id of your newly added theory).

..  code-block:: python

    from nnpdf_data import theory_cards
    from nnpdf_data.theorydbutils import fetch_theory
    theory = fetch_theory(theory_cards, 700)

A script is provided to
give a brief overview of the various theory options available. It can be found
at

	``nnpdf_data/nnpdf_data/disp_theory.py``

and should be run without any arguments.

Theory options are enumerated by an integer ``TheoryID``. The parameters of
each theory option are described in the lookup table under the appropriate ID.
The current available parameters are summarised in :ref:`th_parameter_definitions`.

Theory storage
==============

Each theory configuration is stored as a gzip compressed tar archive with
filename format

	``theory_<THEORYID>.tgz``

and is stored at the location specified in the default ``nnprofile.yaml``. For easy
access, they can be downloaded through the ``vp-get`` utility.  Each archive
contains the following directory structure

	| ``theory_X/``
	|	``-cfactor/``
	|	``-fastkernel/``

Inside the directory ``theory_X/cfactor/`` are stored ``CFACTOR`` files
with the filename format

	``CF_<TYP>_<FKNAME>.dat``

where ``<TYP>`` is a three-letter designation for the source of the C-factor
(e.g. EWK or QCD) and ``<FKNAME>`` is the FK-Table to which it should be applied.

Finally the ``FK`` tables themselves are stored in ``theory_X/fastkernel/``
with the filename format

	``<FKNAME>.pineappl.lz4``

Naturally, all of the FastKernel and C-factor files within the directory
``theory_X/`` have been determined with the theoretical parameters specified in
the theory lookup table under ID ``X``.
