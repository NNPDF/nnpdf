Theory indexes
==============

In the table below you can see explicit content of the ``TheoryIndex`` table
from the ``theory.db`` file. Note that not every theory listed in the database
is available to be downloaded from the :ref:`NNPDF server <server>`. In particular,
theories that are outdated are not stored on the server, but their settings will
remain in the database. To find a list of the theories that are available on the
server, one can use the vp-list script (see :ref:`vp-list`) as so: :code:`vp-
list -r theories`.
