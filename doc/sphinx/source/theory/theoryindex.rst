Theory indexes
==============

In the table below you can see explicit content of the ``TheoryIndex`` table
from the cards in the ``theory_cards`` folder.

The first table summarizes the `000` entries which often contains most of the
relevant information when choosing a theory.
The second table contains all theory indexes available,
most of which can be downloaded from the NNPDF server.
To find a list of the theories that are available on the
server, one can use the vp-list script (see :ref:`vp-list`) as so: :code:`vp-list -r theories`.
