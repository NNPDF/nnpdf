Theory indexes
==============

In the table below you can see explicit content of the ``TheoryIndex`` table
from the cards in the ``theory_cards`` folder. Note that not every theory listed in the database
is available to be downloaded from the NNPDF :ref:`server`. In particular,
theories that are outdated are not stored on the server, but their settings will
remain in the database. To find a list of the theories that are available on the
server, one can use the vp-list script (see :ref:`vp-list`) as so: :code:`vp-list -r theories`.
