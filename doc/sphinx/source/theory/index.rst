Theory
======

This section contains information specific to the way theoretical predictions are stored in the
NNPDF system. First, theoretical background is given on the FK table format, which is the file
format used to store theoretical predictions. Next, the parameters used to define a set of FK
tables, otherwise known as a theory, are given. A table showing the correspondence between the
available theories and these parameters is then given in the next section. Finally, a way to access
this information using the NNPDF code itself is detailed.
