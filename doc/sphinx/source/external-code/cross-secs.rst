Partonic cross section generation
=================================

Many programmes exist to evaluate partonic cross sections. Some are general purpose, such as
MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO and MCFM, in that they compute predictions for a variety of physical processes
(e.g. drell-yan production, single top production, ...) up to a given order. Others are more
specific, such as top++, which makes predictions for top quark pair production only. Some of these
programmes will be briefly outlined here. Note that to produce predictions at NNLO in QCD, which is
the highest order used in NNPDF fits, one usually produces APPLgrids at NLO in QCD, and then
supplements these with NNLO QCD corrections which are computed with a code with NNLO capabilities.
These C-factors are often provided to the collaboration by external parties, rather than the code
being run in-house.

`MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO <https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo>`_ is the programme that will be used for most of
the future NNPDF calculations of partonic cross sections. This is in large part due to its ability
to compute predictions at NLO in QCD with NLO EW corrections. To generate APPLgrids from
MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO, one can use `aMCfast <https://amcfast.hepforge.org/>`_, which interfaces between
the two formats.

Other codes
-----------

`MCFM <https://mcfm.fnal.gov/>`_ ('Monte Carlo for FeMtobarn processes') is an alternative programme
to MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO, which instead uses mcfm-bridge as an interface to generate APPLgrids.

`FEWZ <https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3540>`_ ('Fully Exclusive W and Z Production') is a programme for
calculating (differential) cross sections for the Drell-Yan production of lepton pairs up to NNLO
in QCD.

`NLOjet++ <http://www.desy.de/~znagy/Site/NLOJet++.html>`_ is a programme that can compute cross
sections for a variety of processes up to NLO. The processes include electron-positron annihilation,
deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), photoproduction in electron-proton collisions, and a variety of
processes in hadron-hadron collisions.

`Top++ <http://www.precision.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/top-plus-plus/>`_ is a programme for computing top
quark pair production inclusive cross sections at NNLO in QCD with soft gluon resummation included
up to next-to-next-to-leading log (NNLL).
