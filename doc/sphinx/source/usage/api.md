# Using the validphys API

## Introduction


The API functionality allows the `validphys`/`reportengine` machinery to be
readily leveraged in a development setting such as a Jupyter notebook. Any
action available to `validphys` can be invoked by Python code, with the same
parameters as a runcard.

For example:

```python
from validphys.app import API

figs = API.plot_pdfs(pdfs=["NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118"], Q=2)
for f, _ in figs:
    f.show()
```

The `API` object provides a high level interface to the validphys code.  Note
that the user doesn't need to know exactly how to load the PDF, create the
relevant grid to be plotted and then pass that to the plotting function, this is
all handled by the underlying code of `reportengine`. This abstraction provides
a convenient way to explore the functionality of `validphys` (or any other
`reportengine` application) as well as to develop further functionality for
`validphys` itself.

All the actions available to `validphys` are translated into methods of the `API`
object. The arguments are the same as the parameters that the validphys runcard
would need to evaluate the action.

## Generic Example

An important use case of this functionality is the development
Consider that you wanted to develop a provider which depends on some expensive providers, defined
somewhere in the `validphys` modules,

```python
def expensive_provider1(pdf:PDF, Q, theoryid):
    ...

def expensive_provider2(experiments, ...):
    ...

```

Now in a notebook we can do

```python
from validphys.app import API

expensive1 = API.expesnive_provider1(pdf="NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118", Q=100, theoryid=52)
expensive2 = API.expensive_provider2(experiments={"from_": "fit"}, fit="NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118")

```

We can then define and test our new function (e.g. in a separate notebook cell),

```python
def developing_provider(expensive_provider1, expensive_provider2):
    ...

test_output = developing_provider(expensive1, expensive2)
```

`expensive1` and `expensive2` have already been evaluated using the validphys machinery, and we just
had to declare the `validphys2` runcard inputs in order to use those providers. The output of these
expensive function is now saved. So for the remainder of our notebook session we don't need to
re-run the expensive providers every time we wish to change something with our `developing_provider`.
Clearly this massively reduces the time to develop and test the new provider since, the expensive
providers which the new `developing_provider` depends on are cached for the rest of the jupyter
session.

For `expensive_provider2` the input was slightly more complicated. When using the API remember that
the input is exactly the same as a `validphys2` runcard. The runcards are in a `yaml` format which
is then parsed as a `dict`. If it seems more intuitive one can utilise this when declaring the
inputs for the API providers, for example:

```python
input2 = {
    "experiments": {
        "from_": "fit"
    },
    "fit": "NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118"
}
expensive2 = API.expensive_provider2(**input2)
```

The `input2` dictionary is visually almost identical the corresponding `validphys2` runcard, we just
need to be careful the separate items with commas, that all dict keys are strings and that
the typing is correct for the various inputs, we can always look up the appropriate typing by using
the `validphys --help` functionality.

## Creating figures in the `validphys` style

If a figure is created using the api, as with the first example:

```python
from validphys.app import API

fig = API.some_plot(...)
fig.show()
```

you might notice that the style of the plot is very different to those produce by `validphys`. If you
want to use the same style as `validphys` then consider using the following commands at the top of
your script or notebook:

```python
import matplotlib
from validphys import mplstyles
matplotlib.style.use(str(mplstyles.smallstyle))
```

also consider using `fig.tight_layout()` which reportengine uses before saving figures. For the
example used earlier we would then have

```python
import matplotlib
from validphys import mplstyles
matplotlib.style.use(str(mplstyles.smallstyle))

from validphys.app import API

figs = API.plot_pdfs(pdfs=["NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118"], Q=2)
for f, _ in figs:
    f.tight_layout()
    f.show()
```

## Mixing declarative input with custom resources (NOTE: Experimental)

For some actions it is possible to mix declarative input with custom resources.

Take for example `xplotting_grid`, which minimally requires us to specify
`pdf`, `Q`. We see from `validphys --help xplotting_grid` that it depends on the provider `xgrid`
which in turn returns a tuple of `(scale, x_array)`. Using the API we could specify our own custom
xgrid input, but then rely on the API to collect the other relevant resources, for example:

```python
import numpy as np
from validphys.app import API

new_xgrid = ("linear", np.array([0.1, 0.2])
pdf_grid = API.xplotting_grid(pdf="NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118", Q=2, xgrid=new_xgrid)

```

The API offers flexibility to mix declarative inputs such as `pdf=<name of pdf>` with python objects
`xgrid=(<string>, <numpy.ndarray>)`, note that this is very dependent on the provider in question
and is not guaranteed to work all the time.
