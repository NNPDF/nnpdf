## Installation using conda

### Adding RSA key to Github

To clone the NNPDF Github repositories, you must add a public RSA key to Github.

* Checking for an existing RSA key

	Firstly, check if your machine has already generated an RSA key. This can be done by the following:

		cd ~/.ssh
		ls -a

	and verify the files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` exist. An alternative is to perform `find ~ -name 'id_rsa.*'` and verify `id_rsa.pub` is found.

* Generating an RSA key

	If no RSA key exists use the command 

		ssh-keygen

	and follow the instructions to generate an RSA key.

* Adding the RSA key to Github

	Copy the public RSA key stored in `id_rsa.pub` to your clipboard using

		cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

	and copying the output.

	The public RSA key must be pasted to Github [here](https://github.com/settings/keys) and clicking on the 'New SSH key' button. Enter an appropriate title and paste the RSA Key. 

### Obtain the helper script

A helper script exists to aid the configuration. To obtain it use:

		mkdir nnpdfgit
		cd nnpdfgit
		git clone git@github.com:NNPDF/binary-bootstrap.git

* Execute the script
	
		./binary-bootstrap/bootstrap.sh

	The script will ask you for the password of the NNPDF private repository, which can be found [here](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=292165461)

* **Path**: the conda installer will ask to add the conda bin path to the default *$PATH* environment variable (by editing your  .bashrc file). Confirm this unless you know that you have a specific reason not to. Note that newer versions of conda give the option of having conda available, but not any environment (which you have to enable explicitly by either having  conda activate in .bashrc or typing it each time you want to use the environment). On remote machines, the addition to .bashrc should read as follows

		if shopt -q login_shell; then
			. <path-to-conda>/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
			conda activate
		fi

the if condition is important because conda activate prints to the standard output, which interferes with commands like scp and rsync.

* Note that the script may ask you to perform some actions manually ( e.g. it will not overwrite your existing conda configuration). Please pay attention to the output text of the script.

### Installing the NNPDF code

After the helper script has run, navigate to the miniconda3 installation directory, by default this is `~/miniconda3`, and run the command

		. ./etc/profile.d/conda.sh
		conda activate
		conda install nnpdf

This will provide functioning C++ and Python executables.

**Note:** The installer will set up itâ€™s own version of the LHAPDF code, with its own path for storing PDFs, which can be seen running lhapdf --help. If you have an exiting folder with LHAPDF grids, you may want to either move, symlink or copy them to the new path (depending on whether you want to keep around the older installation). The command for symlinking would be something like:

	ln -s <old path>/share/LHAPDF/* <new path>/miniconda3/share/LHAPDF

This will avoid symlinking the existing LHAPDF configuration, which may be corrupted or incompatible. You should make sure only the grid folders are transferred if you copy or move instead.
