There are many ingredients that go into a PDF fit. For example, one must generate the partonic cross
sections for use in the fit, convert these predictions into a format that is suitable for PDF fits,
i.e. the format must be suitable for on-the-fly convolutions, and evolve the PDFs according to the
DGLAP equations. To perform each of these steps, different codes are used. In this subsection
various codes that you will frequently encounter are described. Note that to find out more about
collinear factorisation, which is the method that enables this separation of a calculation into
distinct parts, you can refer to the [Theory section](collinear.md).

## NNPDF specific codes

validphys and reportengine are two internal NNPDF codes that form the basis of much of the work that
NNPDF does. To read about what validphys and reportengine are and what they do, please refer to the
introductory section of the [vp-guide](./../vp/introduction.md).

## PDF set storage and interpolation

[LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/) is a C++ library that evaluates PDFs by interpolating the
discretised PDF 'grids' that PDF collaborations produce. It also gives its users access to proton
and nuclear PDF sets from a variety of PDF collaborations, including NNPDF, MMHT and CTEQ. A list
of all currently available PDF sets can be found on their
[website](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/pdfsets.html). Particle physics programmes that typically make
use of PDFs, such as Monte Carlo event generators, will usually be interfaced with LHAPDF, to allow
a user to easily specify the PDF set that they wish to use in their calculations. You can read more
about LHAPDF by reading the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7420) that marked their latest
release.

## PDF evolution

[APFEL](https://apfel.hepforge.org/) ('A PDF Evolution Library') is the PDF evolution code currently
used by the NNPDF Collaboration. In addition to its PDF evolution capabilities, it also produces
predictions of deep-inelastic scattering structure functions. In recent years it has been developed
alongside NNPDF, and so it therefore contains the features and settings required in an NNPDF fit.
That is, it includes quark masses in the MSbar scheme, the various FONLL heavy quark schemes, scale
variations up to NLO, etc. Note that at the time of writing, a more streamlined code is being
written to replace APFEL, which is currently dubbed EKO ('Evolution Kernel Operator'). To find more
general information about PDF evolution and the DGLAP equations, you can go to the [Theory
section](dglap.md).

### Other codes

[Hoppet](https://hoppet.hepforge.org/) ('Higher Order Perturbative Parton Evolution Toolkit') is an
alternative PDF evolution code which is capable of evolving unpolarised PDFs to NNLO and linearly
polarised PDFs to NLO. The unpolarised evolution includes heavy-quark thresholds in the MSbar
scheme.

## Grid generation

Grids play a crucial role in NNPDF fits. This is because they enable otherwise very time consuming
computations to be computed on the fly during an NNPDF fit. The guiding principle behind producing
grids is that the maximum possible amount of information should be computed before a PDF fit, so
that the smallest possible number of operations has to be carried out during a fit. There are two
particularly important types of grid: APPLgrids and FK ('Fast Kernel') tables. APPLgrids contain
information on the partonic cross section (otherwise known as hard cross sections or coefficient
functions) while FK tables combine APPLgrids with DGLAP evolution kernels from APFEL. This therefore
means that FK tables can simply be combined with PDFs at the fitting scale to produce predictions
for observables at the scale of the process.

[APPLgrid](https://applgrid.hepforge.org/) is a C++ programme that allows the user to change certain
settings within observable calculations a posteriori. Most importantly, the user can change the PDF
set used, but they can also alter the renormalisation scale, factorisation scale and the strong
coupling constant. Without APPLgrids, such changes would usually require a full rerun of the code,
which is very time consuming. Moreover, these features are crucial for PDF fits, where hard cross
sections must be convolved with different PDFs on the fly many times. APPLgrid works for hadron
collider processes up to NLO in QCD, although work is ongoing to also include NLO electroweak
corrections in the APPLgrid format. In addition to the standard version of APPLgrid, a modified
version of APPLgrid exists which includes photon channels. This is known as APPLgridphoton. To
learn how to generate APPLgrids, please see the tutorial [here](../tutorials/APPLgrids.md).

APFELcomb generates FK tables for NNPDF fits. You can read about the mechanism behind APFELcomb
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02070) and find more information about the theory behind FK tables
in the [Theory section](../Theory/FastInterface.rst).

#### Other codes

[fastNLO](https://fastnlo.hepforge.org/) is an alternative code to APPLgrid, which is currently not
used by NNPDF, since the grids produced by fastNLO are not interfaced with the NNPDF code.

## Partonic cross section generation

Many programmes exist to evaluate partonic cross sections. Some are general purpose, such as
MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO and MCFM, in that they compute predictions for a variety of physical processes
(e.g. drell-yan production, single top production, ...) up to a given order. Others are more
specific, such as top++, which makes predictions for top quark pair production only. Some of these
programmes will be briefly outlined here. Note that to produce predictions at NNLO in QCD, which is
the highest order used in NNPDF fits, one usually produces APPLgrids at NLO in QCD, and then
supplements these with NNLO QCD corrections which are computed with a code with NNLO capabilities.
These C-factors are often provided to the collaboration by external parties, rather than the code
being run in-house.

[MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) is the programme that will be used for most of
the future NNPDF calculations of partonic cross sections. This is in large part due to its ability
to compute predictions at NLO in QCD with NLO EW corrections. To generate APPLgrids from
MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO, one can use [aMCfast](https://amcfast.hepforge.org/), which interfaces between
the two formats.

### Other codes

[MCFM](https://mcfm.fnal.gov/) ('Monte Carlo for FeMtobarn processes') is an alternative programme
to MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO, which instead uses mcfm-bridge as an interface to generate APPLgrids.

[FEWZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3540) ('Fully Exclusive W and Z Production') is a programme for
calculating (differential) cross sections for the Drell-Yan production of lepton pairs up to NNLO
in QCD.

[NLOjet++](http://www.desy.de/~znagy/Site/NLOJet++.html) is a programme that can compute cross
sections for a variety of processes up to NLO. The processes include electron-positron annihilation,
deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), photoproduction in electron-proton collisions, and a variety of
processes in hadron-hadron collisions.

[Top++](http://www.precision.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/top-plus-plus/) is a programme for computing top
quark pair production inclusive cross sections at NNLO in QCD with soft gluon resummation included
up to next-to-next-to-leading log (NNLL).
