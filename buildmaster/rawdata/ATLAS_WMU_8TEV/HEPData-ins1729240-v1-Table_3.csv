#: description: Cross-sections (differential in $\eta_{\mu}$) and asymmetry, as a function of $|\eta_{\mu}|$). The central values are provided along with the statistical and dominant systematic uncertainties: the data statistical uncertainty (Data Stat.), the $E_T^{\textrm{miss}}$ uncertainty, the uncertainties related to muon reconstruction (Muon Reco.), those related to the background, those from MC statistics (MC Stat.), and modelling uncertainties. The uncertainties of the cross-sections are given in percent and those of the asymmetry as an absolute difference from the nominal.
