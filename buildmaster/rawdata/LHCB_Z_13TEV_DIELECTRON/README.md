Data for Z boson production at the LHCb experiment in proton proton collision at 13 TeV.
The analysis uses a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 294 +- 11 pb^(-1).
Event considered are those where Z decays either to a dimuon or a dielecron final state.
 
Data from paper arXiv:1607.06495v2 :
 - differential distributions from table 5
 - corelation matrices from tables 8 (dimuon final state) and 9 (dielectron final state)
