#: name: Table 6
#: description: Measured double-differential dijet cross sections for the range 2.5 <= y* < 3.0 and jet radius parameter R = 0.4.  The statistical uncertainties from data and MC simulation have been combined.  The three columns correspond to nominal, stronger or weaker correlations between jet energy scale uncertainty components.
