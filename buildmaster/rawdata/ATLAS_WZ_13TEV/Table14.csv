#: description: Measured fiducial cross section for a single leptonic decay channel $\ell'^\pm \nu \ell^+ \ell'^-$ of the $W
The relative uncertainties are reported as percentages. 
The systematic uncertainties are in order of appearance: total uncorrelated systematic and correlated systematics related respectively to 
unfolding, electrons, muons, jets, reducible and irreducible backgrounds and pileup. 
the last bin is a cross section for all events above the lower end of the bin.
