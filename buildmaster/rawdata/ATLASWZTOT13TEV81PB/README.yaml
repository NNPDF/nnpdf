description: W and Z Total cross sections at 13 TeV measured by ATLAS with 81pb.

output_units: fb

implementation_details: >
  ATLAS W and Z total cross section measurements. The data is manually
  copied from http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09222v2.pdf (Note that there
  is a v1 and the values are different). Values in 
  data.txt are taken from Table 3, first header row "Measured cross
  section x BR (W->lv, Z->ll) [nb], "Fiducial".
  The units for the cross section are nanobarn, and are converted to
  fb for storage in the CommonData format.
  The central scales (k2) are the dilepton mass for the Z, which we
  choose to set to the Z mass, and Mw for W (in GeV).
  The center of mass energy (k3) is 13 TeV.
