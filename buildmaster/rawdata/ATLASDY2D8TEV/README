Filename:

HMDYMeasurement.mass     - single-differential measurement
HMDYMeasurement.rapidity - double-differential measurement as a function of absolute rapidity
HMDYMeasurement.deta     - double-differential measurement as a function of absolute pseudorapidity separation



The files contains a header specific to the xFitter tool and then
the actual data after the line "&END". Each row contains the following
information in the various columns:
bin center (in dilepton mass and absolute dilepton rapidity or absolute pseudorapidity difference, where applicable)
cross section in pb/GeV
statistical uncertainty in percent
X sources of systematic uncertainties in percent

The systematic uncertainties should be treated either as fully
correlated or uncorrelated as described below and in the row
"ColumnName", where "uncor" corresponds to an uncorrelated uncertainty.
Any other names correspond to unique sources of correlated uncertainties 
to be treated fully correlated over the full measurement range, also across 
different files and uncorrelated to any other sources of uncertainty.

Description of individual columns in order of appearance

uncor 			- Uncorrelated part of the systematic uncertainties (uncorrelated)
sysHMDYComb_****	- Correlated systematic uncertainites (correlated)
lumi			- Luminosity uncertainty (correlated)
