#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between |$p_{out}^{t\bar{t}}$| (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $p_{T}^{t,had}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-40, 40-80, 80-120, 120-170, 170-230, 230-600] GeV Columns: [0-60, 60-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-260, 260-320, 320-400, 400-500] GeV
