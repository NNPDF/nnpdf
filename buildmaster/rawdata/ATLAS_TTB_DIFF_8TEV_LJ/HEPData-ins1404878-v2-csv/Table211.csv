#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $H_T^{t\bar{t}}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $|y^{t,had}|$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-90, 90-140, 140-195, 195-255, 255-320, 320-385, 385-455, 455-530, 530-610, 610-695, 695-780, 780-865, 865-950, 950-1041, 1041-1500] GeV Columns: [0-0.4, 0.4-0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.2-1.6, 1.6-2.5]
