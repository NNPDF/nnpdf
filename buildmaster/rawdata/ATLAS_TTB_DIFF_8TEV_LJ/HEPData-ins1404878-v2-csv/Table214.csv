#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $H_T^{t\bar{t}}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $m^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-90, 90-140, 140-195, 195-255, 255-320, 320-385, 385-455, 455-530, 530-610, 610-695, 695-780, 780-865, 865-950, 950-1041, 1041-1500] GeV Columns: [345-400, 400-470, 470-550, 550-650, 650-800, 800-1100, 1100-1600] GeV
