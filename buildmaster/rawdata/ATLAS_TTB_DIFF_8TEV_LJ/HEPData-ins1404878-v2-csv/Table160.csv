#: name: Table 160
#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $H_T^{t\bar{t}}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $p_{T}^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from absolute spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-90, 90-140, 140-195, 195-255, 255-320, 320-385, 385-455, 455-530, 530-610, 610-695, 695-780, 780-865, 865-950, 950-1041, 1041-1500] GeV Columns: [0-20, 20-45, 45-75, 75-120, 120-190, 190-300] GeV
