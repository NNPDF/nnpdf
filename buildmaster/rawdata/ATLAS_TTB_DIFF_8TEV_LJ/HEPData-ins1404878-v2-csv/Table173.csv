#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $p_{T}^{t,had}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $|y^{t\bar{t}}|$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from absolute spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-60, 60-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-260, 260-320, 320-400, 400-500] GeV Columns: [0-0.3, 0.3-0.6, 0.6-0.9, 0.9-1.3, 1.3-2.5]
