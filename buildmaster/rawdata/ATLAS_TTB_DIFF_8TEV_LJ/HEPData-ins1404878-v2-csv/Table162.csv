#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $y_{boost}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $|y^{t,had}|$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from absolute spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3, 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.5, 0.5-0.6, 0.6-0.7, 0.7-0.8, 0.8-0.9, 0.9-1, 1-1.1, 1.1-1.2, 1.2-1.3, 1.3-1.4, 1.4-1.5, 1.5-2] GeV Columns: [0-0.4, 0.4-0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.2-1.6, 1.6-2.5]
