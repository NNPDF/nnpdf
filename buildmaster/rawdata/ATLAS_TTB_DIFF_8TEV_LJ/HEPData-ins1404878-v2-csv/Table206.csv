#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $\Delta\phi^{t\bar{t}}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $|y^{t\bar{t}}|$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0.0-2.0, 2.0-2.75, 2.75-3.0, 3.0-3.15] Columns: [0-0.3, 0.3-0.6, 0.6-0.9, 0.9-1.3, 1.3-2.5]
