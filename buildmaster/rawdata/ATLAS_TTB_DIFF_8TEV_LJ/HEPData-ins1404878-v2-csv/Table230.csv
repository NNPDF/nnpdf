#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $p_{T}^{t,had}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $p_{T}^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-60, 60-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-260, 260-320, 320-400, 400-500] GeV Columns: [0-20, 20-45, 45-75, 75-120, 120-190, 190-300] GeV
