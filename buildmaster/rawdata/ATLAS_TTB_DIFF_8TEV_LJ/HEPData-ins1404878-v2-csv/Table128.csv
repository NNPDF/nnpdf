#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between |$p_{out}^{t\bar{t}}$| (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $\chi^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from absolute spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-40, 40-80, 80-120, 120-170, 170-230, 230-600] GeV Columns: [1-1.4, 1.4-1.9, 1.9-2.5, 2.5-3.2, 3.2-4.2, 4.2-5.5, 5.5-7.2, 7.2-9.3, 9.3-12, 12-20] GeV
