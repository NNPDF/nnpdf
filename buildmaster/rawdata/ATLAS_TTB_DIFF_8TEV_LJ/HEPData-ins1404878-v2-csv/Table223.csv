#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $p_{T}^{t,had} (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $|y^{t,had}|$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-60, 60-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-260, 260-320, 320-400, 400-500] GeV Columns:  [0-0.4, 0.4-0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.2-1.6, 1.6-2.5]
