#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $\Delta\phi^{t\bar{t}}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $|y^{t,had}|$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0.0-2.0, 2.0-2.75, 2.75-3.0, 3.0-3.15] Columns: [0-0.4, 0.4-0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.2-1.6, 1.6-2.5]
