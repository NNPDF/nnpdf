#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $|y^{t\bar{t}}|$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $p_{T}^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from absolute spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-0.3, 0.3-0.6, 0.6-0.9, 0.9-1.3, 1.3-2.5] Columns: [0-20, 20-45, 45-75, 75-120, 120-190, 190-300] GeV
