#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $|y^{t,had}|$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $p_{T}^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-0.4, 0.4-0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.2-1.6, 1.6-2.5] Columns: [0-20, 20-45, 45-75, 75-120, 120-190, 190-300] GeV
