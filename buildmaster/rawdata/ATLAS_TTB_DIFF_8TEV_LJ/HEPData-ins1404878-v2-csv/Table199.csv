#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $\chi^{t\bar{t}}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $m^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [1-1.4, 1.4-1.9, 1.9-2.5, 2.5-3.2, 3.2-4.2, 4.2-5.5, 5.5-7.2, 7.2-9.3, 9.3-12, 12-20] GeV Columns: [345-400, 400-470, 470-550, 550-650, 650-800, 800-1100, 1100-1600] GeV
