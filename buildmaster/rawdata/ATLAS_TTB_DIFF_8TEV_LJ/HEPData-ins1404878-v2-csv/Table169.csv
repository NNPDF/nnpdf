#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $|y^{t,had}|$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $|y^{t\bar{t}}|$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from absolute spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-0.4, 0.4-0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.2-1.6, 1.6-2.5] Columns: [0-0.3, 0.3-0.6, 0.6-0.9, 0.9-1.3, 1.3-2.5]
