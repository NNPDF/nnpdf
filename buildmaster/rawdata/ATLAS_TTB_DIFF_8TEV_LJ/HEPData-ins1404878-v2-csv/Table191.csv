#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between |$p_{out}^{t\bar{t}}$| (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $p_{T}^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-40, 40-80, 80-120, 120-170, 170-230, 230-600] GeV Columns: [0-20, 20-45, 45-75, 75-120, 120-190, 190-300] GeV
