#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $\chi^{t\bar{t}}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $y_{boost}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from absolute spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [1-1.4, 1.4-1.9, 1.9-2.5, 2.5-3.2, 3.2-4.2, 4.2-5.5, 5.5-7.2, 7.2-9.3, 9.3-12, 12-20] GeV Columns: [0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3, 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.5, 0.5-0.6, 0.6-0.7, 0.7-0.8, 0.8-0.9, 0.9-1, 1-1.1, 1.1-1.2, 1.2-1.3, 1.3-1.4, 1.4-1.5, 1.5-2] GeV
