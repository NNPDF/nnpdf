#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $p_{T}^{t,had}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $m^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from absolute spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-60, 60-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-260, 260-320, 320-400, 400-500] GeV Columns: [345-400, 400-470, 470-550, 550-650, 650-800, 800-1100, 1100-1600] GeV
