#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between $m^{t\bar{t}}$ (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $p_{T}^{t\bar{t}}$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [345-400, 400-470, 470-550, 550-650, 650-800, 800-1100, 1100-1600] GeV Columns: [0-20, 20-45, 45-75, 75-120, 120-190, 190-300] GeV
