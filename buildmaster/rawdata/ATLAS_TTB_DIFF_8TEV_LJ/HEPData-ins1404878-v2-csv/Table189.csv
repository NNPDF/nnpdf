#: description: Statistical correlation matrix between |$p_{out}^{t\bar{t}}$| (rows) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration and $|y^{t\bar{t}}|$ (columns) in the 4-jet inclusive configuration, obtained at parton level from relative spectra through the Bootstrap Method. The binning is the following: Rows: [0-40, 40-80, 80-120, 120-170, 170-230, 230-600] GeV Columns: [0-0.3, 0.3-0.6, 0.6-0.9, 0.9-1.3, 1.3-2.5]
