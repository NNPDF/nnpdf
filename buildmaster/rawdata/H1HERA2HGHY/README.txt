The high-y data is taken from the HERA-II H1 publication

Measurement of the Inclusive e{\pm}p Scattering Cross Section at High Inelasticity y and of the Structure Function FL

Comments:	70 pages, 29 figures, 23 tables
Subjects:	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
Journal reference:	Eur.Phys.J.C71:1579,2011
DOI:	10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1579-4
Report number:	DESY 10-228

And the recommendation from the H1 management is to add Tables 10
and 11 of this paper.

Since the papers are not available in .txt format, they have
been extracted from the Latex source of the paper

These tables provide the NC reduced cross sections (since it is at low Q2,
no difference between electrons and positros). Uncertainties are quoted
in percent. There is on top of that a global normalisation uncertainty of 3% 

Threre are 5 sources of correlated systematic errors, which
are common in table 10 and Table 11
