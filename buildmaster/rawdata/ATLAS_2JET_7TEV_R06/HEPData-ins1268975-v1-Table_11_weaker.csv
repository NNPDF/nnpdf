#: name: Table 11
#: description: Measured double-differential dijet cross sections for the range 2.0 <= y* < 2.5 and jet radius parameter R = 0.6.  The statistical uncertainties from data and MC simulation have been combined.  The three columns correspond to nominal, stronger or weaker correlations between jet energy scale uncertainty components.
