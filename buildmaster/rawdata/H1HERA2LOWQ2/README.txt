The H1 HERA-II low-Q2 data has been obtained from

http://www-h1.desy.de/psfiles/figures/d10-228.syst_460_575.txt

The data is for reduced NC DIS cross sections

Since the data is well below the MZ threshold, we can use for the theory computations
either to assume electrons or to assume positrons

This data is part of DESY-10-228

Data files contain:
d10-228.syst_460_575.dat  -- combination of the Ep=460 GeV and Ep=575 GeV HERA-II data
d10-228.syst_820_920.dat  -- combination of the Ep=920 HERA-II and Ep=820, 920 GeV HERA-I

#########################################################################
Please note that the data in d10-228.syst_820_920.dat are NOT independent
of the H1+Zeus combined data in DESY-09-158, JHEP01 (2010) 109 and should
NOT be used together with them.

The bin numbers correspond to those in Tables 16-21 of DESY 10-228

Q^2 values are given in GeV^2. x,y are Bjorken x and inelasticity. Sr stands for the reduced cross section. 
F2 stands for the structure function F2. CME stands for centre-of-mass energy.

Errors are quoted in % of the reduced cross sections.

-----------------------------------------------------------
stat           stands for the statistical uncertainty.
unc            stands for the uncorrelated systematic uncertainty.
corr           is the sum in quadrature of sysL1-sysL8 for 460-575 and sysN1-sysN47 for 820-920 sample. 
tot            is the sum of stat, unc and cor in quadrature, which is the total  uncertainty.
               
SysN1-SysN47,   
SysL1-SysL8    are the correlated systematic experimental systematic error sources.
               They are uncorrelated between 460-575 and 820-920 data.
