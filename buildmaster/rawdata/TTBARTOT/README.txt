******************************

The data is for the most precise ttbar total cross sections
from

- Tevatron Run II
- ATLAS 7 TeV
- CMS 7 TeV
- ATLAS 8 TeV
- CMS 8 TeV

For the time being the data is the same as in 

 M.~Czakon, M.~L.~Mangano, A.~Mitov and J.~Rojo,
  %``Constraints on the gluon PDF from top quark pair production at hadron colliders,''
  arXiv:1303.7215 [hep-ph].

But can be updated in the near future if more
precise measurements become available

The format is

Index TotalXsec  TotalExpError

Where the total experimental error is given in
absolute values
