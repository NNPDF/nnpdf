# NNPDF/nnpdf

The main repository of the NNPDF framework. 

This project contains the following components:
- libnnpdf: core NNPDF utility library.
- nnpdfcpp: programs used in the NNPDF fitting framework. 
- validphys2: the fit result analysis framework.

## Installation

Two installation options are available: using a binary package, and building
from source. For production purposes (rather than for code development) the binary
package is the recommended approach.

### Binary packages

The master version of the `nnpdf` package and its dependencies can be obtained
in binary format, as a conda package. Installation of the conda package is managed
by the `NNPDF/binary-bootstrap` code. It can be cloned as: 

```Shell 
    git clone git@github.com:NNPDF/binary-bootstrap.git 
    ./binary-botstrap/bootstrap.sh 
```

The script will ask for the password of the private NNPDF repositories. It is:
``` BifaSali9 ```. Once the script has finished, the nnpdf software can be
installed by:

```Shell 
    conda install nnpdf
```

When the packages are installed, the necessary binaries are added to the `bin/`
directory of the corresponding conda environment (which is typically in the
`PATH`). Users can run `vp-setupfit`, `nnfit`, or `postfit` from any directory.

By default, data files (both from theory and experiment) are installed to:
`<conda root>/share/NNPDF/data` and fit results will be written to 
`<conda root>/share/NNPDF/results`.

These paths can be changed by tweaking `nnprofile.yaml` as described in [NNPDF
paths and URLs](#nnpdf-paths-and-urls).

Detailed conda installation instructions can be found in the [validphy2 guide](
https://data.nnpdf.science/validphys-docs/guide.html).

### From source

If you intend to work on the code, then building from source is the
recommended installation procedure. However, you can still use conda
to get all the dependecies and setup the validphys and C++ development
environment. Further information is available in the
[vp-guide](https://data.nnpdf.science/validphys-docs/guide.html#development-installs)

For precise version requirements, see 
[the conda specification](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/blob/master/conda-recipe/meta.yaml).


#### Compiling the code

Compile-time configuration is handled by cmake. A typical installation begins
to the directory [installation prefix] begins with:

```Shell 
    mkdir build 
    cd build 
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[installation prefix] 
``` 

You can then check the configuration with `ccmake .. `. Once you are happy with
your settings, proceed with

```Shell 
    make && make install
``` 

Which will copy binaries and scripts to the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` that you
selected, while the content of `nnpdfcpp/data` folder will be copied to the
`data_path` set in nnprofile.yaml.

## Using the code

### nnfit runcard

The runcard is written in YAML. The runcard is the unique identifier of a fit, it is also the
only required configuration input required for many programs of this repository.

### Workflow

0. compile the code and install

1. Create a runcard by taking as template one of the files in `<profile_prefix>/config`. 
The `<profile_prefix>` path is by default `<install prefix>/share/NNPDF` for source installation 
while `<conda root>/share/NNPDF` for conda installation.

2. Download the specific theory folder using `vp-get theoryID
<theoryid>` where `<theoryid>` is the number specified in your
runcard. Download the t0 PDF set with `vp-get pdf <t0pdfset>` where
`<t0pdfset>` is the string specified in the runcard.

3. Prepare the fit: ```vp-setupfit <runcard>.yml``` this command will
generate a `<runcard_folder>` folder in the current directory with a
copy of the original YAML runcard.

4. All programs take the `<runcard_folder>` as input, e.g.  ```nnfit
<replica_number> <runcard_folder> ``` where replica_number goes from 1-n.

5. Wait until you have fit results, then use `postfit
<number_of_replicas> <runcard_folder>` to finalize the PDF set by
applying post selection criteria. This will produce a set of
`<number_of_replicas>+1` replicas.

6. Upload the results using `vp-upload --fit <runcard_folder>` then
install the fitted set with `vp-get fit <fit_name>`.

7. Analyze results with `validphys`, see the [vp-guide](https://data.nnpdf.science/validphys-docs/guide.html#development-installs).

## NNPDF paths and URLS

The paths that various codes (such as `nnfit` and `validphys`) will use to find
and write resources, as well as the URLS to upload and download them are defined
in a `nnprofile.yaml` file. By default, it is stored in the `nnpdf` install
prefix, under `<nnpdf install prefix>/share/NNPDF/nnprofile.yaml`. For binary
packages, the `nnpdf` install prefix is simply the path of the conda
environment where the packages is installed.  The paths and URLs can be
modified: This can be useful to make the code work under specific cluster
configurations, for example to avoid excessive I/O in NFS mounts. However, do
not do it by editing the `nnprofile.yaml` file in the default location, since it
will be overwritten every time that `nnpdf` is installed.  Instead copy it to
some other location, make the changes you wish, and define an
`NNPDF_PROFILE_PATH` environment variable pointing to your modified file. For
example, you could write in your `.bashrc`: ```shell export
NNPDF_PROFILE_PATH=/home/user/mynnprofile.yaml ```

### Code development policy/rules

Developers must never commit code structure modifications to master. The
development pattern should follow these rules:
- Open an issue explaining your bug or feature request. If you report a bug,
  post information to reproduce it.
- The resolution of issues must be performed in a new branch through a pull
  request.
- If you have already a local version of the code that you would like to merge
  in the master, open a pull request.
- The pull request must be reviewed by at least 2 core developers.

### Code documentation

The C++ code is documented with Doxygen, if you find methods or classes not fully
documented open a issue request.

the code design see Chapter 3 of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00209.pdf
