# NNPDF: An open-source machine learning framework for global analyses of parton distributions

[The NNPDF collaboration](http://nnpdf.science) determines the structure of the
proton using Machine Learning methods. This is the main repository of the
fitting and analysis frameworks. In particular it contains all the necessary
tools to [reproduce](https://docs.nnpdf.science/tutorials/reproduce.html) the
[NNPDF4.0 PDF determinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02653).

## Documentation

The documentation is available at <https://docs.nnpdf.science/>

## Install

See the [NNPDF installation guide](https://docs.nnpdf.science/get-started/installation.html)
for instructions on how to install and use the code,
using either [conda](https://docs.nnpdf.science/get-started/installation.html#installation-using-conda) or [pip](https://docs.nnpdf.science/get-started/installation.html#installation-using-pip),
requirements and [dependencies](https://docs.nnpdf.science/get-started/installation.html#dependencies-and-requirements)
As a first step we recommend to follow one of the [tutorials](https://docs.nnpdf.science/tutorials/run-fit.html).

While we aim to keep the tip of the master branch always stable, tested and correct,
runs of the code intended for publication should use one the [released](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/releases) versions.
