This folder demostrates a simplistic application of `reportengine` to
the problem of studying the Iris Flower Dataset.

The code and examples are short and to the point so they can be easily
adapted.

Install with

```bash
flit install
```

This will install an executable called ``flowers`` in your path.

Run with

```bash
flowers <runcard.yaml>
```

See help with

```bash
flowers --help
```
