This file exists solely for me to be able to upload a package to PyPI for the nnpdf data which does not depend
on the rest of the NNPDF code.
This file should not be modified. Everything in this file is deprecated and should be removed, and the only reason
this is needed is because we are still mixing new and old data.

This also means that _things_ that would've been loaded as a kinematic transformation or result transformation
