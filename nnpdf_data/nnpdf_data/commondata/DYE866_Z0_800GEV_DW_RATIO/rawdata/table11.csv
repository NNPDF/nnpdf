#: name: Table 4
#: description: The cross section ratio and the ratio and differences between the parton distribution functions (PDF) for the dbar and ubar sea quarks determined from the combination of all data sets. The quantities extracted from the cross section ratio are given for a mean Q**2 of 54 GeV**2. The systematic unxcertainty on the ratio is ledd than 1 PCT.
