comment: "Single- and double-differential cross-section measurements are presented for the production of top-quark pairs, in the\
  \ all hadronic channel in the resolved topology at particle and parton level. The results are presented as a function of several\
  \ kinematic variables characterising the top and $t\\bar{t}$ system and\
  \ jet multiplicities. The study was performed using data from pp collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected\
  \ in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), corresponding to an integrated luminosity\
  \ of 36 fb$^{âˆ’1}$. Due to the large $t\\bar{t}$ cross-section at the LHC, such measurements allow a detailed study of the\
  \ properties of top-quark production and decay, enabling precision tests of several Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order\
  \ Standard Model predictions. Overall, there is good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the data.\n"

  Relative differential cross-section as a function of $\Delta R^{extra1}_{jet1}$ at particle level in the all hadronic resolved topology. Note that the values shown here are obtained by propagating the individual uncertainties to the measured cross-sections, while the covariance matrices are evaluated using pseudo-experiments as described in the text. The measured differential cross-section is compared with the prediction obtained with the Powheg+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator.

Note that the values shown here are obtained by propagating the individual uncertainties to the measured cross-sections, while the covariance matrices are evaluated using pseudo-experiments as described in the text. The measured differential cross-section is compared with the prediction obtained with the Powheg+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator.

  Relative differential cross-section as a function of $\Delta R^{extra3}_{extra1}$ at particle level in the all hadronic resolved topology. Note that the values shown here are obtained by propagating the individual uncertainties to the measured cross-sections, while the covariance matrices are evaluated using pseudo-experiments as described in the text. The measured differential cross-section is compared with the prediction obtained with the Powheg+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator.

Note that the values shown here are obtained by propagating the individual uncertainties to the measured cross-sections, while the covariance matrices are evaluated using pseudo-experiments as described in the text. The measured differential cross-section is compared with the prediction obtained with the Powheg+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator.

Note that the values shown here are obtained by propagating the individual uncertainties to the measured cross-sections, while the covariance matrices are evaluated using pseudo-experiments as described in the text. The measured differential cross-section is compared with the prediction obtained with the Powheg+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator.

  Relative double-differential cross-section as a function of $p_{T}^{t,2}$ vs $m^{t\bar{t}}$ at particle level in the all hadronic resolved topology in 835.0 GeV < $m^{t\bar{t}}$ < 1050.0 GeV. Note that the values shown here are obtained by propagating the individual uncertainties to the measured cross-sections, while the covariance matrices are evaluated using pseudo-experiments as described in the text. The measured differential cross-section is compared with the prediction obtained with the Powheg+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator.

  Relative double-differential cross-section as a function of $|y^{t,2}|$ vs $m^{t\bar{t}}$ at parton level in the all hadronic resolved topology in 970.0 GeV < $m^{t\bar{t}}$ < 3000.0 GeV. Note that the values shown here are obtained by propagating the individual uncertainties to the measured cross-sections, while the covariance matrices are evaluated using pseudo-experiments as described in the text. The measured differential cross-section is compared with the prediction obtained with the Powheg+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator.

  Absolute double-differential cross-section as a function of $p_{T}^{t,1}$ vs $p_{T}^{t,2}$ at parton level in the all hadronic resolved topology in 450.0 GeV < $p_{T}^{t,2}$ < 1000.0 GeV. Note that the values shown here are obtained by propagating the individual uncertainties to the measured cross-sections, while the covariance matrices are evaluated using pseudo-experiments as described in the text. The measured differential cross-section is compared with the prediction obtained with the Powheg+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator.
