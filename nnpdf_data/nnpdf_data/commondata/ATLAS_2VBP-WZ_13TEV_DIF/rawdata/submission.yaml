comment: "CERN-LHC. This paper presents measurements of $W^{\\pm}Z$ production in
  $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $13$ TeV. The data were collected
  in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment  at the Large Hadron Collider, and correspond
  to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$. The $W^{\\pm}Z$ candidate events
  are reconstructed using leptonic decay modes into  electrons and muons of the gauge
  bosons. The measured inclusive cross section in the detector fiducial region for
  leptonic decay modes is\n$\\sigma_{W^\\pm Z \\rightarrow \\ell^{'} \\nu \\ell \\ell}^{\\textrm{fid.}}
  =  63.7  \\, \\pm~1.0~\\textrm{(stat.)} \\, \\pm~2.3~\\textrm{(sys.)} \\, \\pm~0.3~\\textrm{(mod.)}
  \\, \\pm~1.5~\\textrm{(lumi.)}$ fb, in agreement with the next-to-next-to-leading-order
  Standard Model prediction of $61.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ fb. Cross sections for $W^+Z$
  and $W^-Z$ production and their ratio are presented as well as differential cross
  sections for several kinematic observables. An analysis of angular distributions
  of lepton decays of $W$ and $Z$ bosons is performed and integrated helicity fractions
  in the detector fiducial region are measured for each of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons.
  The longitudinal polarisation of  pair-produced vector bosons is measured for the
  first time in  $pp$ collisions.\n\nThe cross sections are measured in a fiducial
  phase space reflecting the detector acceptance, defined by:\n- $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$
  of electrons and muons from Z0 decays > 15 GeV\n- $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ of electrons
  and muons from the $W^{\\pm}$ decays > 20 GeV\n- $|\\eta|$ of muons and electrons
  < 2.5\n- Leptons from the Z0 boson are separated by $\\Delta R(\\ell,\\ell) > 0.2$
  from each other\n- Leptons from the Z0 and W bosons are separated by $\\Delta R(\\ell,\\ell)
  > 0.3$ from each other\n- |dilepton mass - Z0 mass| < 10 GeV\n- $m_{\\mathrm{T}}$
  of $W^{\\pm}$ > 30 GeV.\n\n\nAt particle level, the kinematics of final-state prompt
  electrons and muons is computed including the contributions from \nfinal-state radiated
  photons within a distance in the ($\\eta,\\phi$) plane of \n$\\Delta R = \\sqrt{(\\Delta\\eta)^2
  + (\\Delta\\phi)^2} = 0.1$ around the direction of the charged lepton. \nThese dressed
  leptons and the final-state neutrinos that do not originate from hadron or $\\tau$
  decays  are \nassociated with the $W$ and $Z$ boson decay products with an algorithmic
  approach, called ``resonant shape''. \nThis algorithm is  based on the value of
  an estimator expressing the product of the nominal line shapes of \nthe $W$ and
  $Z$ resonances\n\n   $P = \\left| \\frac{1}{ m^2_{(\\ell^+,\\ell^-)} - \\left(m_Z^{\\textrm{PDG}}\\right)^2
  + i \\; \\Gamma_Z^{\\textrm{PDG}} \\; m_Z^{\\textrm{PDG}} } \\right|^2  \\times
  \\; \\left| \\frac {1} { m^2_{(\\ell',\\nu_{\\ell'})} - \\left(m_W^{\\textrm{PDG}}\\right)^2
  + i \\; \\Gamma_W^{\\textrm{PDG}} \\; m_W^{\\textrm{PDG}} } \\right|^2$\n\nwhere
  $m_Z^{\\textrm{PDG}}$ ($m_W^{\\textrm{PDG}}$) and $\\Gamma_Z^{\\textrm{PDG}}$ ($\\Gamma_W^{\\textrm{PDG}}$)
  are the \nworld average mass and total width of the $Z$ ($W$) boson, respectively,
  as reported by the Particle Data Group. \nThe input to the estimator is the invariant
  mass $m$ of all possible pairs ($\\ell^+,\\ell^-$) and\n($\\ell',\\nu_{\\ell'}$)
  satisfying the fiducial selection requirements. \nThe final choice of which leptons
  are assigned to the $W$ or $Z$ bosons corresponds to the configuration \nexhibiting
  the highest value of the estimator."
