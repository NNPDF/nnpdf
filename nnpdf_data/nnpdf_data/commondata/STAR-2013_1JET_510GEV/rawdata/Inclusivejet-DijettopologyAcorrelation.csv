#: name: Inclusive jet - Dijet topology A correlation
#: description: The correlation matrix for the point-to-point uncertainties (statistical and systematics) for the inclusive jet measurements coupling with the forward-forward dijet measurements (topology A). The relative luminosity and beam polarization uncertainties are not included because they are the same for all points.
