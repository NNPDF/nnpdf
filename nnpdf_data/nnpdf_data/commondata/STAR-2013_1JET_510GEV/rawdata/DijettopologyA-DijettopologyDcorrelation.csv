#: name: Dijet topology A - Dijet topology D correlation
#: description: The correlation matrix for the point-to-point uncertainties (systematics only) coupling forward-forward dijet measurements (topology A) with forward-central dijet measurements (topology D). The relative luminosity and beam polarization uncertainties are not included because they are the same for all points.
