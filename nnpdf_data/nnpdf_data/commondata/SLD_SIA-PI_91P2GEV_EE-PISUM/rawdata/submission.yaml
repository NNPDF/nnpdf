  SLAC-SLC. Measurement of the cross sections for identified stable charged particle production in Z0 decays resulting from E+ E- interactions. The data comprises identified overall charged PI+-, K+- and P PBAR distributions from 400000 hadronic events collected in SLC runs between 1996 and 1998 and supercedes the previous measurements reported in PR D59 (1990) 052001. The data are analysed forall hadronic Z0 decays and for decays into light all, c and b quarks separately .

  Production rates of all stable charged particles. The statistical and systematic errors are shown separately for the momentum distribution. They are combined in quadrature for the other two distributions. The first DSYS error is due tothe uncertainty in the track finding efficiency and the second DSYS error is th e rest of the systematic error.
