  DESY-PETRA. TASSO COLLABORATION. THE PRESENT DATA IS AN EXTENSION OF THAT PRESENTED IN BRANDELIK ET AL., PL 113B, 98 (1982). AT W=14 AND 22 GEV, DATA SAMPLES IDENTICAL TO THOSE IN THE ABOVE REFERENCE ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE K+, K- AND P, AP YIELDS. AT W=34 GEV, IN ADDITION TO MEASURING THE K+, K- AND P, AP YIELDS, THE ANALYSIS FOR PI+, PI- HAS BEEN REPEATED WITH A DATA SAMPLE OF APPROX. TWICE THE SIZE USED IN THE ABOVE REFERENCE. THE SCALING VARIABLE IS X(P=3,DEF=2*E(P=3)/SQRT(X)) AND BETA IS P(P=3)/E(P=3).
