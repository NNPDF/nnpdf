comment: "CERN-LHC.

This paper presents measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections for W+W- production in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider using an integrated luminosity of 36.1fb-1. The candidate events are selected using one electron and one muon, corresponding to the decay of the diboson system as WW-> e nu mu nu. In order to suppress top quark background, events containing jets with a transverse momentum exceeding 35 GeV are not included in the measurement phase space. The fiducial cross section, six differential distributions and the cross section as a function of the jet-veto transverse momentum threshold are measured and compared to several theoretical predictios. Constraints on anomalous week boson self-interactions are also presented in the framework of a dimension-six effective field theory."
