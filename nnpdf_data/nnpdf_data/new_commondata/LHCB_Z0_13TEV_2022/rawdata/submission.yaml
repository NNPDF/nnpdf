comment: A precision measurement of the $Z$ boson production cross-section at $\sqrt{s}
  = 13$ TeV in the forward regionis presented, using $pp$ collision data collected
  by the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 fb$^{-1}$.
  The production cross-section is measured using $Z\to \mu^+ \mu^-$ events within
  the fiducial region defined as pseudorapidity $2.0<\eta<4.5$ and transverse momentum
  $p_{T}>20$ GeV/$\it{c}$ for both muonsand dimuon invariant mass $60<M_{\mu \mu}<120$
  GeV/$\it{c}^{2}$. The integrated cross-section is determined to be\begin{equation*}\sigma(Z\rightarrow
  \mu^{+} \mu^{-}) = 196.4 \pm 0.2 \pm 1.6 \pm 3.9~pb,\end{equation*}where the first
  uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is due to the
  luminosity determination.The measured results are in agreement with theoretical
  predictions within uncertainties.
