  DESY-HERA. Measurement of the inclusive jet differential cross sections in neutral current deep inelastic scattering of 27.5 GeV positrons from 820 GeV protons with boson virtualities Q**2 & gt; 125 GeV. The data were taken during the 1996-97 HERA running period and have an integrated luminsoity of 38.6 pb-1. Jets areidentified in the Breit frame using the longitudinal kT cluster algorithm.
