  DESY-HERA. Measurement of the inclusive-jet and dijet differential cross sections in neutral current deep inelastic scattering of 27.5 GeV positrons and electrons on 920 GeV protons at a centre of mass energy 319 GeV. The data, which cover photon virtualities (Q**2) & gt; 125 GeV**2 were collected during the 1998-2000 running period and have an integrated luminosity of 81.7 +- 1.8 pb-1. Jets were selected in the Breit frame with a longitudinally invariant KT cluster algorithm.. In the tables the first DSYS error is the uncorrelated systematic uncertainty and the second is the jet-energy-scale uncertainty.
