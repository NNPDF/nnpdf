comment: "DESY-HERA. Inclusive jet, dijet and trijet differential cross sections are\
  \ measured in neutral current deep-inelastic scattering for exchanged boson virtualities\
  \ 150 < Q**2 < 15000 GeV**2 using the H1 detector at HERA. The data were taken in\
  \ the years 2003 to 2007 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 351 pb^{-1}.\
  \  \n\nDouble differential jet cross sections are obtained using a regularised unfolding\
  \ procedure. They are presented as a function of Q**2 and the transverse momentum\
  \ of the jet, PT(JET), and as a function of Q**2 and the proton longitudinal momentum\
  \ fraction, XI, carried by the parton participating in the hard interaction. In\
  \ addition normalised double differential jet cross sections are measured as the\
  \ ratio of the jet cross sections to the inclusive neutral current cross sections\
  \ in the respective Q**2 bins of the jet measurements.  \n\nIn dijet and trijet\
  \ cross section measurements the variables used are labelled MEAN(PT(2JET)) and\
  \ XI(2), and MEAN(PT(3JET)) and XI(3), respectively. These are defined as: \n -\
  \ MEAN(PT(2JET)) = (1/2) * ( PT(JET(1)) + PT(JET(2)) ). \n - MEAN(PT(3JET)) = (1/3)\
  \ * ( PT(JET(1)) + PT(JET(2)) + PT(JET(3)) ). \n - XI(2) = X * ( 1 + (M(12)**2 /\
  \ Q**2) ) where X is the Bjorken scaling variable and M(12) is the invariant mass\
  \ of the two leading jets. \n - XI(3) = X * ( 1 + (M(123)**2 / Q**2) ) where M(123)\
  \ is the invariant mass of the three leading jets. \n\nCompared to earlier work,\
  \ the measurements benefit from an improved reconstruction and calibration of the\
  \ hadronic final state. The cross sections are compared to perturbative QCD calculations\
  \ in next-to-leading order and are used to determine the running coupling and the\
  \ value of the strong coupling constant as ALPHAS(M(Z)) = 0.1165 +- 0.0008 (exp)\
  \ +- 0.0038 (pdf,theo).\n"
