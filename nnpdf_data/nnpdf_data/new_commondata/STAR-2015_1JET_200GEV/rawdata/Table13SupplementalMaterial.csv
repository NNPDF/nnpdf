#: description: The correlation matrix for the point-to-point uncertainties coupling dijet measurements with the $\textrm{sign}(\eta_1) \neq \textrm{sign}(\eta_2)$ topology and the $\textrm{sign}(\eta_1) = \textrm{sign}(\eta_2)$ topology. The $A_{LL}$ uncertainty contribution of $0.0007$ from uncertainty in the relative luminosity measurement and $6.1\%$ from the beam polarization uncertainty, which are common to all the data points, are separated from the listed values.
