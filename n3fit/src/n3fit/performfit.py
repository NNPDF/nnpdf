    This action will (upon having read a validcard) process a full PDF fit
    for a set of replicas.

    The input to this function is provided by validphys
    and/or defined in the runcards or commandline arguments.

    This controller is provided with:
    1. Seeds generated using the replica number and the seeds defined in the runcard.
    2. Loaded datasets with replicas generated.
        2.1 Loaded positivity/integrability sets.

    The workflow of this controller is as follows:
    1. Generate a ModelTrainer object holding information to create the NN and perform a fit
        (at this point no NN object has been generated)
        1.1 (if hyperopt) generates the hyperopt scanning dictionary
                taking as a base the fitting dictionary and the runcard's hyperscanner dictionary
    2. Pass the dictionary of parameters to ModelTrainer
                                    for the NN to be generated and the fit performed
        2.1 (if hyperopt) Loop over point 4 for `hyperopt` number of times
    3. Once the fit is finished, output the PDF grid and accompanying files
