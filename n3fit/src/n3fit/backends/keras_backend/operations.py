"""
    This module contains the list of operations that can be used within the
    ``call`` method of the ``n3fit`` layers as well as operations that can
    act on layers.

    This includes an implementation of the NNPDF operations on fktable in the keras
    language (with the mapping ``c_to_py_fun``) into Keras ``Lambda`` layers.

    The rest of the operations in this module are divided into three categories:
    numpy to tensor:
        Operations that take a numpy array and return a tensorflow tensor
    tensor to tensor:
        Operations that take a tensor and return a tensor
    layer generation:
        Instanciate a layer to be applied by the calling function

    Some of these are just aliases to the backend (tensorflow or Keras) operations
    Note that tensor operations can also be applied to layers as the output of a layer is a tensor
    equally operations are automatically converted to layers when used as such.
