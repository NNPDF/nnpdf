    """
    This function generates the observable model for each experiment.
    These are models which takes as input a PDF tensor (1 x size_of_xgrid x flavours) and outputs
    the result of the observable for each contained dataset (n_points,)

    An experiment contains an fktable, which is loaded by the convolution layer
    (be it hadronic or DIS) and a inv covmat which loaded by the loss.

    This function also outputs three "output objects" (which are functions that generate layers)
    that use the training and validation mask to create a training_output, validation_output
    and experimental_output

    If the dataset is a positivity dataset acts in consequence.

    The output is a dictionary (`layer_info`), each one of the three output functions
    have a signature:

        `def out_tr(pdf_layer, dataset_out=None)`

    The `pdf_layer` must be a layer of shape (1, size_of_xgrid, flavours)
    `datasets_out` is the list of dataset to be masked to 0 when generating the layer

    Parameters
    ----------
        spec_dict: dict
            a dictionary-like object containing the information of the experiment
        positivity_initial: float

    Generates the PDF model which takes as input a point in x (from 0 to 1)
    and outputs a basis of 14 PDFs.
    It generates the preprocessing of the x into a set (x, log(x)),
    the arbitrary NN to fit the form of the PDF
    and the preprocessing factors.

    The funtional form of the output of this function is of:

        f_{i}(x) = R_{ji} N(x)_{j} * x^{1-alpha_{j}} * (1-x)^{beta_{j}}

    Where i goes from 1 to 14 while j goes from 1 to the size of the basis. R_{ji}
    is the rotation from the fitting basis to the physical basis needed for the
    convolution with the fktables.


    `layer_type` defines the architecture of the Neural Network, currently
    the following two options are implemented:
        - `dense`
            it will generate a densely connected networks where all nodes of layer n
            are connected with all nodes of layer n+1 (and n-1), the output layer is
            of the size of the last item in the `nodes` list (usually 8)
        - `dense_per_flavour`
            similar to `dense` but the nodes are disconnected in a per-flavour basis
            This means at the end of the PDF (and before the preprocessing)
            we have 8 (or whatever number) nodes just as before, but from the input
            to the output the nodes are disconnected

    This is a complicated function comprised of several sections:

    1. As initialization a number of checks are carried outs to ensure the number of layers
    and the number of activation functions match up.

    2. The neural network NN(x) is constructed depending on the requested layer_type

    3. Break the input into (x, log(x)) and passes down to the NN.
    The output of the NN in the previous step is a list of independent layers.
    A function is constructed that joins all those layers. The function takes a
    tensor as the input and applies all layers for NN in order.

    4. Create a preprocessing layer (that takes as input the same tensor x as the NN)
    and multiply it to the NN. We have now:
        N(x)_{j} * x^{1-alpha_{j}} * (1-x)^{beta_{j}}

    5. Create a rotation layer (that takes as input the previous step) and applies it
    so that we get f(x)_{i}

    Finally we output the final answer as well as the list of all generating functions
    in the model for easy usage within `n3fit`.

    Parameters
    ----------

            selects the initializer of the weights of the NN. Default: glorot_normal

        flav_info: dict
