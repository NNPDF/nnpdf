# This RunCard is used to generate the effective exponents plots implemented
# in eff_exponents.py. Effective exponents study potential power law behaviour
# of pdfs in the high and low x regimes.

Q: 1.65 # Q is the PDF scale in GeV.
basis: 'evolution' # The evolution basis of the DGLAP equations
normalize_to: 1 # The Ratio of Effective exponents from different pdf sets

pdfs:
    - NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118
    - NNPDF30_nnlo_as_0118

actions_:
   - - plot_alphaEff
   - - plot_betaEff
