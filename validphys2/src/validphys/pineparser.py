    Receives a fkspec, which contains the path to the fktables that are to be read by pineappl

    The fkspec contains also the cfactors which are applied _directly_ to each of the fktables.

    The output of this function is an instance of FKTableData which can be generated from reading
    several FKTable files which get concatenated on the ndata (bin) axis.

    For more information on the reading of pineappl tables:
        https://pineappl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/pineappl/pineappl.html#pineappl.pineappl.PyFkTable

    About the reader:
        Each pineappl table is a 4-dimensional grid with:
            (ndata, active channels, x1, x2)
        for DIS grids x2 will contain one single number.
        The luminosity channels are given in a (flav1, flav2) format and thus need to be converted
        to the 1-D index of a (14x14) luminosity tensor in order to put in the form of a dataframe.

        All grids in pineappl are constructed with the exact same xgrid,
        the active channels can vary and so when grids are concatenated for an observable
        the gaps are filled with 0s.

        The pineappl grids are such that obs = sum_{bins} fk * f (*f) * bin_w
        so in order to use them together with old-style grids (obs = sum_{bins} fk * xf (*xf))
        it is necessary to remove the factor of x and the normalization of the bins.

    About apfelcomb flags in yamldb files:
        old commondata files and old grids have over time been through various iterations while remaining compatibility between each other,
        and fixes and hacks have been incorporated in one or another
        for the new theory to be compatible with old commpondata it is necessary
        to keep track of said hacks (and to apply conversion factors when required)
    NOTE: both conversion factors and apfelcomb flags will be eventually removed.
