def calc_chi2(sqrtcov, diffs):
    """Elementary function to compute the chi², given a Cholesky decomposed
    lower triangular part and a vector of differences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sqrtcov : matrix
        A lower tringular matrix corresponding to the lower part of
        the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix.
    diffs : array
        A vector of differences (e.g. between data and theory).
        The first dimenssion must match the shape of `sqrtcov`.
        The computation will be broadcast over the other dimensions.

    Returns
    -------
    chi2 : array
        The result of the χ² for each vector of differences.
        Will have the same shape as ``diffs.shape[1:]``.

    Notes
    -----
    This function computes the χ² more efficiently and accurately than
    following the direct definition of inverting the covariance matrix,
    :math:`\chi^2 = d\Sigma^{-1}d`,
    by solving the triangular linear system instead.
