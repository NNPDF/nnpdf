comment: |
  DESY-HERA.  Single- and double-differential inclusive dijet cross sections in neutral current deep inelastic ep scattering have been measured with the ZEUS detector using an integrated luminosity of 374 pb^-1. The measurement was performed at large values of the photon virtuality, Q^2, between 125 and 20000 GeV^2. The jets were reconstructed with the k_T cluster algorithm in the Breit reference frame and selected by requiring their transverse energies in the Breit frame, E_T,B^jet, to be larger than 8 GeV. In addition, the invariant mass of the dijet system, M_jj, was required to be greater than 20 GeV. The cross sections are described by the predictions of next-to-leading-order QCD.

  The measured differential cross-sections $d\sigma/dQ^2$ for inclusive dijet production. The statistical, uncorrelated systematic and jet-energy-scale (ES) uncertainties are shown separately. The multiplicative corrections, ${C_{\rm{QED}}}$, which have been applied to the data and the corrections for hadronisation and ${Z^{0}}$ effects to be applied to the parton-level NLO QCD calculations, ${C_{\rm{hadr}}\cdot C_{\rm{Z^{0}}}}$, are shown in the last two columns.
