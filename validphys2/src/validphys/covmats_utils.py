    """Basic function to create a systematics matrix , :math:`A`, such that:

    .. math::

        C = A A^T

    Where :math:`C` is the covariance matrix. This is achieved by creating a
    block diagonal matrix by adding the uncorrelated systematics in quadrature
    then taking the square-root and concatenating the correlated systematics,
    schematically:

    .. code::python

        A = concat([diag(sqrt(A_uncorr.sum(axis=1))), A_corr])

    Parameters
    ----------
    stat_errors: np.array
        a 1-D array of statistical uncertainties
    sys_errors: pd.DataFrame
        a dataframe with shape (N_data * N_sys) and systematic name as the
        column headers. The uncertainties should be in the same units as the
        data.

    Notes
    -----
    This function doesn't contain any logic to ignore certain contributions to
    the covmat, if you wanted to not include a particular systematic/set of
    systematics i.e all uncertainties with MULT errors, then filter those out
    of ``sys_errors`` before passing that to this function.

    statistical error and a dataframe of systematics.

    Errors with name UNCORR or THEORYUNCORR are added in quadrature with
    the statistical error to the diagonal of the covmat.

    Other systematics are treated as correlated; their covmat contribution is
