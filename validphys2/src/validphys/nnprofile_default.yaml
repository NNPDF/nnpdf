# Default `nnprofile.yaml` for NNPDF.
# The location of a custom profile can be given with the `NNPDF_PROFILE_PATH` enviroment variable
# otherwise by default ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/.config/NNPDF/nnprofile.yaml will be read
# which in most systems defaults to `~/.config/NNPDF/nnprofile.yaml`
#  
#
# The following defines where NNPDF resources will be stored
# The directories for results / theories / hyperscan / validphys are declared as
# relative to the nnpdf_share unless explicitly written as absolutes
#
# nnpdf_share accepts the special value ${PYTHON_PREFIX}
# which will default to `python -c "import sys ; print(sys.prefix + "/share/NNPDF/")"`
# and that usually is:
#   ${CONDA_PREFIX}/share/NNPDF in conda installations
#   ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/share/NNPDF in virtual-env installations
#   /usr in most Linux installations
#
# As a bug-prevention measure, if `nnpdf_share` is set to an empty variable
# or (if set to PYTHON_PREFIX) to a non-writtable directory, the code will refuse to run

# Default to ${PYTHON_PREFIX}, i.e., the prefix or wherever NNPDF was installed
# it (usually) corresponds to ${CONDA_PREFIX} in conda environments and ${VIRTUAL_ENV} in virtual environments
# for instance, if you want all your NNPDF installations to share theories you can do
# nnpdf_share: ~/.local/share/NNPDF/
nnpdf_share: RELATIVE_TO_PYTHON
