Using conda

Download the appropriate version for your OS from:

http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html


Either download a python 3 version of conda, or else if you have
a python 2 one, create a python 3 installation ("environment") doing:

conda create -name py3 python=3

and then every time you want to use (or install something in that) do:

source activate py3

and then install swig with:

conda install swig


= INSTALL

Set the --enable-pywrap flag for configure (in the top level linnpdf
folder). 

./configure --enable-pywrap

And after having the library installed, type

make wrapper

This should install the wrapper in your current Python 3 environment.
